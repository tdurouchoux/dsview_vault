SWE-Bench is a dataset based on real-world GitHub issues and corresponding fixes. It is designed to evaluate the performance of models in retrieval-augmented generation tasks for coding agents. The dataset contains examples of GitHub issues and the files that need to be modified to fix these issues, making it relevant for assessing the ability of models to retrieve contextually appropriate code snippets.
