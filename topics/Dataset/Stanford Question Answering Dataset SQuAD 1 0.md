The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 1.0 is a benchmark dataset designed for evaluating the performance of question-answering systems. It consists of a collection of documents paired with questions and corresponding answers. SQuAD 1.0 focuses on precise, context-aware answers within single passages, making it a robust platform for assessing the ability of models to understand and retrieve information from textual contexts. The dataset is widely used in the research community to benchmark and compare the performance of different question-answering models and techniques.
