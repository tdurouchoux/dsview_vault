COCONut is a large-scale human-verified dataset for segmentation tasks. It is designed to provide high-quality annotations for various segmentation types, including instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation. The dataset is available in multiple splits such as COCONut-S, COCONut-B, COCONut-L, and COCONut-XL, each varying in the number of images and masks. COCONut is intended for research purposes and follows the same license as the COCO dataset, restricting commercial use. It is highlighted for its extensive and meticulously annotated data, making it a valuable resource for advancing segmentation techniques in the era of big data.
