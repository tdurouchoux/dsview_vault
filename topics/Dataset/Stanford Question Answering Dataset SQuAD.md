The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a benchmark dataset designed for evaluating the performance of question-answering systems. It consists of a collection of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to each question is a text span from the corresponding reading passage. SQuAD is widely used to train and test models on their ability to understand and extract precise information from given contexts.
