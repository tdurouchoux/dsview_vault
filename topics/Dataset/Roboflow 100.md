Roboflow 100 is a new object detection benchmark introduced in November 2022 and presented at CVPR in June 2023. It consists of 100 projects spanning a wide array of imagery domains and task targets, derived from over 90,000 public datasets and 60 million public images. The benchmark aims to advance the state-of-the-art in object recognition by evaluating how models adapt to diverse problems in healthcare, aerial imagery, video games, and more. It includes 224,714 images, 829 class labels, and required 11,170 labeling hours.
