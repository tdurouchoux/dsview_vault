HotPotQA is a question-answering dataset designed to evaluate the multi-hop reasoning capabilities of language models. It consists of questions that require gathering information from multiple documents to arrive at the correct answer. HotPotQA is used to test the ability of models to perform complex reasoning tasks by integrating information from diverse sources, making it a valuable resource for advancing research in natural language understanding and question-answering systems.
