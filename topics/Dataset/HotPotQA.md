HotPotQA is a question-answering dataset designed to evaluate the multi-hop reasoning capabilities of models. It consists of documents paired with questions and golden responses, emphasizing the need for models to reason across multiple documents to provide accurate answers. HotPotQA provides a complementary challenge to datasets like SQuAD, focusing on more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. The dataset is used to assess the performance of models in handling tasks that require integrating information from various sources to generate coherent and accurate responses.
