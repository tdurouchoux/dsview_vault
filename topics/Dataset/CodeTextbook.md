CodeTextbook is a dataset composed of a filtered code-language subset of The Stack and StackOverflow, obtained using a language model-based classifier. It consists of about 6 billion tokens and is designed to provide high-quality, instructive, and balanced examples of coding concepts and skills. This dataset is used in the pretraining phase to obtain the base model phi-1-base.
