CodeExercises is a small synthetic exercises dataset consisting of approximately 180 million tokens of Python exercises and solutions. It is generated by GPT-3.5 and is used for finetuning the phi-1-base model to obtain phi-1. The dataset is designed to align the model to perform function completion tasks based on natural language instructions and to unlock further coding capabilities.
