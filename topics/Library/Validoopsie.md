Validoopsie is a lightweight and user-friendly data validation library for Python. It is designed to help users easily declare classes and chain validations together, similar to popular DataFrame libraries. It supports the 'Bring Your Own DataFrame' (BYOD) concept, allowing the use of any DataFrame supported by Narwhals. The library aims to simplify the data validation process, making it accessible and straightforward for tasks such as checking data integrity and ensuring compliance with data standards.
