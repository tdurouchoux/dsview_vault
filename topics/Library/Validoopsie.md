Validoopsie is a lightweight and user-friendly data validation library for Python. It allows developers to declare classes and chain validations together, similar to popular DataFrame libraries. It supports the 'Bring Your Own DataFrame' (BYOD) concept, enabling the use of any DataFrame supported by Narwhals for data validation tasks. The library is designed to be simple and readable, drawing inspiration from Great Expectations to streamline the data validation process.
