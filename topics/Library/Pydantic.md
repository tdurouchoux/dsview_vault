Pydantic is a data validation library that focuses on schema validation for dictionaries, such as those ingested from JSON files. It allows users to define schemas via classes and provides desirable behavior 'for free' that comes from this. Pydantic is particularly useful for validating non-tabular data and integrates with other Python tools like FastAPI for building APIs. It is production-grade and is used by organizations like the UK Home Office.
