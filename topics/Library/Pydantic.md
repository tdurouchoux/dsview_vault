Pydantic is a data validation library that focuses on validating Python data structures, particularly dictionaries and JSON data. It uses Python's type system and base classes to define schemas for data validation. Pydantic is highly flexible and can validate arbitrarily complex objects. It integrates well with other Python tools like FastAPI for building APIs.
