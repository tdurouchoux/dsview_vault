LiteLLM is a Python library that allows developers to call any large language model (LLM) using the OpenAI format. It provides a unified format for inputs and outputs, making it easy to switch between different LLMs without rewriting the entire stack. LiteLLM offers features like streaming responses, cost tracking, and a proxy API server. It also includes load balancing and rate limiting capabilities to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.
