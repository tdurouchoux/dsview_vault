PandasAI is a Python library that enables users to interact with their data using natural language processing. It allows both technical and non-technical users to perform data analysis, generate visualizations, and ask complex questions about their data using large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It supports various data formats such as SQL, CSV, and parquet, and can be integrated into Jupyter notebooks, Streamlit apps, or used with a client-server architecture. It also offers a Docker sandbox for secure and isolated execution of code.
