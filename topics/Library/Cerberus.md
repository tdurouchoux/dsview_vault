Cerberus is a lightweight data validation library that provides powerful yet simple data validation functionality out of the box. It is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for custom validation. Cerberus defines schemas using text-based dictionaries and returns True or False for validations. It is similar to Pydantic but is less fully featured and does not integrate with dataframe and data source tools without further work by the user.
