Cerberus is a lightweight data validation library that provides powerful yet simple data validation functionality. It defines schemas using text-based dictionaries and supports custom validation. Cerberus returns True or False for validations and is designed to be easily extensible. It is similar to Pydantic but with a different approach to schema definition and validation.
