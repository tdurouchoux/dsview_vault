TensorFlow GNN (TF-GNN) is a production-tested library for building Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) at scale. It supports both modeling and training in TensorFlow, as well as the extraction of input graphs from huge data stores. TF-GNN provides tools for developers to build models over graph data and customize their models for processing on TPUs.
