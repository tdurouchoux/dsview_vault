TensorFlow GNN (TF-GNN) is a production-tested library designed for building Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) at scale. It supports both modeling and training in TensorFlow, and the extraction of input graphs from large data stores. TF-GNN is optimized for heterogeneous graphs, where types and relations are represented by distinct sets of nodes and edges, making it suitable for real-world objects and their relationships.
