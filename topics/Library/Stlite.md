Stlite is a library that enables running Streamlit applications entirely in a web browser using Pyodide and WebAssembly. It allows for the creation of serverless Streamlit apps that can be executed without the need for a backend server, leveraging the power of WebAssembly to run Python code directly in the browser. Stlite provides functionalities to mount Streamlit apps, manage file systems, and handle dependencies, making it a versatile tool for developing and deploying data applications in a browser environment.
