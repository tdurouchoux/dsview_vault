ReactPy is a Python package for building user interfaces (UI) without JavaScript. It allows developers to create interfaces using small, reusable components, similar to ReactJS. ReactPy interfaces can be built for various backends, such as Flask, FastAPI, Sanic, Tornado, Django, Jupyter, and Plotly-Dash. It implements most of the React features like state management, hooks, components, and others, enabling the creation of dynamic frontend applications with Python.
