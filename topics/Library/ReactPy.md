ReactPy is a Python package for building user interfaces (UI) without JavaScript. It allows developers to create interfaces using small, reusable components, similar to ReactJS. ReactPy interfaces can be built for various backends, such as Flask, FastAPI, Sanic, Tornado, Django, Jupyter, and Plotly-Dash. Basically, anything you can build in ReactJS can be built in ReactPy. Most of the React features like state management, hooks, components and others are already implemented in ReactPy.
