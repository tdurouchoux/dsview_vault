pyobsplot is a Python library that allows users to create charts in Jupyter or Marimo notebooks and Quarto documents using Observable Plot. It enables the creation of plots from Python code with a syntax that closely resembles the JavaScript syntax of Observable Plot. This library facilitates the integration of Observable Plot's capabilities into Python-based data science workflows.
