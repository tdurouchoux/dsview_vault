Leafmap is an open-source Python library for interactive mapping and geospatial data visualization. It is built on top of the Folium and ipyleaflet libraries and provides a user-friendly interface for creating and customizing maps. Leafmap supports a wide range of geospatial data formats, including vector and raster data, and offers tools for adding layers, markers, and other map elements. It is particularly useful for visualizing and exploring geospatial data in Jupyter notebooks and other interactive computing environments.
