Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface. Ruff can replace multiple tools like Flake8, Black, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and autoflake, executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool. It supports pyproject.toml, has built-in caching, fix support for automatic error correction, and over 800 built-in rules. Ruff is used in major open-source projects like Apache Airflow, Apache Superset, FastAPI, Hugging Face, Pandas, and SciPy.
