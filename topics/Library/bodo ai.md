Bodo.ai is a high-performance computing platform that accelerates Python and Pandas code through just-in-time (JIT) compilation. It is designed to optimize data processing tasks, making them significantly faster, especially for large datasets. Bodo.ai can be integrated with Pandas to enhance performance without changing the existing codebase. Bodo DataFrames is a library designed to be a drop-in replacement for Pandas, offering optimized and parallelized data processing capabilities. It aims to enhance performance by automatically optimizing and parallelizing code where possible, falling back to Pandas seamlessly when certain APIs are not yet supported. This library is particularly useful for handling large datasets efficiently.
