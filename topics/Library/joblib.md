Joblib is a Python library that provides tools for running Python functions as jobs in parallel using multiprocessing, and it also includes utilities for caching and memoization. It is particularly useful for optimizing the performance of data processing tasks by caching intermediate results to disk, which can significantly reduce the time required for repeated computations.
