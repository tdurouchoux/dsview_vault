Joblib is a Python library that provides tools for running Python functions as jobs in parallel using multiprocessing, and it also offers utilities for caching and memoization. It is particularly useful for optimizing the performance of functions that involve expensive computations or I/O operations by caching their results to disk, allowing for faster subsequent executions.
