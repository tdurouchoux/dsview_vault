MLX is an array framework designed for machine learning on Apple silicon. It features a NumPy-like API and offers innovative capabilities like composable function transformations, lazy computation, and dynamic graph construction. MLX's multi-device capability allows operations to run on CPU, GPU, or NPU, with a unified memory model that enables operations on any supported device without time-expensive data transfers.
