SQL-tString is a library that allows for f-string like construction of SQL queries without allowing for SQL injection. It provides a way to construct SQL queries in a safe and convenient manner, converting parameters to SQL placeholders where appropriate. It supports different SQL dialects and can be used with Python versions 3.12 and 3.13, in addition to Python 3.14 which introduced t-strings via PEP 750.
