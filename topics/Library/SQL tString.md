SQL-tString is a library that allows for f-string like construction of SQL queries without allowing for SQL injection. It provides a way to construct SQL queries in a safe and convenient manner, converting parameters to SQL placeholders where appropriate and allowing predefined column or table names to be used. It supports different SQL dialects and can be used with Python versions 3.12 and 3.13, in addition to 3.14 which introduced t-strings.
