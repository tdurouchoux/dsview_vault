DSPy is a framework designed for programming language models, allowing users to define tasks through signatures and letting the framework handle the prompting details. It provides modules like Predict, ChainOfThought, and others to generate and optimize prompts for LLM tasks. DSPy aims to reduce the time spent on prompting by automating the process and allowing users to focus on defining their tasks.
