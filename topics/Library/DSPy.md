DSPy is a framework designed for programming language models, allowing users to define tasks through signatures and letting the framework handle the prompt generation and optimization. It reduces the time spent on manual prompting by providing boilerplate prompting and modules that apply specific prompt techniques. DSPy also supports prompt optimization based on training data, making it easier to achieve better results with less manual effort.
