jsonschema is a data validation library specifically focused on validating JSON data. It allows users to define schemas for JSON data and validate instances against these schemas. jsonschema is similar to Cerberus but is specifically designed for JSON validation. It is useful for ensuring that JSON data conforms to a specified schema and can help catch errors early in the data processing pipeline.
