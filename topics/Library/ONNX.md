The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open-source format for representing machine learning models. It enables models to be transferred between different frameworks, runtimes, and compilers, facilitating interoperability and portability across various platforms and tools. ONNX allows data scientists to train models in one framework and deploy them in another, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in the machine learning workflow.
