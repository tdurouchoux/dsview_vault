Voila is an open-source library for turning Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications or dashboards. It allows users to create interactive web applications from Jupyter notebooks, where each user gets a personal kernel for running the notebook cells. This ensures that all graphs and widgets remain interactive, similar to a local environment. Voila is secure, easy to install and use, and supports custom themes and popular Python widgets. It is particularly useful for sharing Jupyter notebooks but is limited to notebook-based applications and may face performance issues with many widgets.
