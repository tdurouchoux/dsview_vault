Unsloth is a library designed for fine-tuning and reinforcement learning of large language models (LLMs). It supports various models such as OpenAI's gpt-oss, Qwen3, Llama 4, DeepSeek-R1, Gemma 3, and TTS. The library is optimized to train these models 2x faster with 70% less VRAM, making it highly efficient for tasks involving large-scale language models. It includes features like support for full-finetuning, pretraining, 4-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit training, and compatibility with transformer-style models including TTS, STT, multimodal, diffusion, BERT, and more. The library is designed to work on NVIDIA GPUs since 2018 and supports both Linux and Windows operating systems.
