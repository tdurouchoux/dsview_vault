Unsloth is an open-source library designed for fine-tuning and reinforcement learning of large language models (LLMs). It supports various models like OpenAI's gpt-oss, Qwen3, Llama 4, DeepSeek-R1, Gemma 3, and TTS. The library is optimized to train these models 2x faster with 70% less VRAM, making it highly efficient for resource-constrained environments. Unsloth provides tools for model fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and supports a wide range of transformer-style models including TTS, STT, multimodal, diffusion, BERT, and more. It is compatible with various GPU architectures and operating systems, including Linux and Windows.
