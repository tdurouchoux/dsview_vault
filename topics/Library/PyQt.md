PyQt is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit, implemented as a Python plug-in. It serves primarily as a powerful GUI module, seamlessly integrating the robust Qt C++ cross-platform framework with the flexible Python programming language. PyQt is organized into several modules, each tailored for specific tasks, such as QtCore for core non-GUI functionalities and QtGui for GUI functionalities. It is widely used for developing graphical applications due to its modern collection of widgets and its compatibility with various operating systems, including Windows, Unix, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.
