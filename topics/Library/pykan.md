Pykan is a Python library designed for implementing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). It provides tools and functionalities to leverage the mathematical foundations of KANs, which are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Pykan allows users to build, train, and utilize KANs, which are alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and offer advantages in terms of model accuracy and interpretability. The library includes features for hyperparameter tuning, model visualization, and symbolic regression, making it a versatile tool for various machine learning tasks, particularly those requiring high accuracy and interpretability.
