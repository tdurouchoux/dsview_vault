Gradio is an open-source Python library used for creating interactive web interfaces for machine learning models. It allows developers to quickly build customizable UIs with minimal code, making it easier to share and deploy models. Gradio supports various input and output types, including text, images, audio, and more. In the context of Kotaemon, Gradio is used to build the user interface for the RAG-based document QA tool, providing a clean and minimalistic UI for end users and developers.
