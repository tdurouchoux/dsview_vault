SQLModel is a Python library that integrates SQLAlchemy for database operations and Pydantic for data validation. It provides a streamlined way to define database models, handle sessions, and interact with databases using Python objects. SQLModel simplifies the process of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a database by leveraging the strengths of both SQLAlchemy and Pydantic. It is particularly useful for developers who need to manage database operations in a type-safe and validated manner.
