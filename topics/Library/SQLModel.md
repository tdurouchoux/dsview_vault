SQLModel is a Python library that integrates SQLAlchemy for database operations with Pydantic for data validation. It provides a streamlined way to define database models, handle sessions, and interact with databases using Pythonic syntax. SQLModel simplifies the process of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in a database, making it easier to work with SQL databases in Python applications.
