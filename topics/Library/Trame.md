Trame is an open-source platform that simplifies the creation of interactive and visually stunning web applications with minimal knowledge of web development or technology. It is based on Python and leverages platforms such as VTK, ParaView, and Vega to create web-based applications in minutes. Trame provides a high-level framework for building reactive, stateful web applications, and it can be used locally as any desktop application but also be deployed in the cloud or on-premise to access big and/or sensitive data. Trame comes with lots of capabilities built-in by leveraging existing libraries or tools such as Vuetify, Altair, Vega, Deck, VTK, ParaView, and more.
