A Python library for fast and scalable node embedding algorithms. It supports various algorithms like Node2Vec, GGVec, ProNE, and GraRep, and can be used to embed nodes in graph objects and arbitrary scipy CSR Sparse Matrices. It is designed to work natively with NetworkX graph types and can also utilize any Scikit-Learn API model that supports the fit_transform method with the n_component attribute.
