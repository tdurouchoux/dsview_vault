NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. NumPy is widely used in data science and machine learning for its efficiency and ease of use. NumPy 2 is an upcoming major release that introduces some backward-incompatible changes, which means existing codebases may need updates to remain functional.
