Haystack is an open-source framework for building search systems that work intelligently with your data. It provides a wide range of algorithms for document search, question answering, and semantic search, using both traditional and deep learning-based approaches. Haystack is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing users to mix and match different algorithms and components to create custom search systems tailored to their specific needs.
