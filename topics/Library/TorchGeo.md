TorchGeo is a PyTorch domain library designed for geospatial data, providing datasets, samplers, transforms, and pre-trained models. It aims to simplify the use of geospatial data for machine learning experts and remote sensing experts exploring machine learning solutions. The library supports various geospatial datasets, including those with different coordinate reference systems (CRS) and resolutions, and offers tools for combining and sampling from these datasets. It also includes benchmark datasets for tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, and supports pre-trained models on multispectral sensors. TorchGeo integrates with PyTorch data loaders and provides Lightning datamodules for easy experimentation with different datasets and models. Torchange is a geospatial library designed to facilitate the integration of geospatial data with deep learning workflows. It provides tools for handling and preprocessing geospatial data, such as satellite imagery and vector data, in a format compatible with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. torchange aims to streamline the process of preparing geospatial data for machine learning tasks, enabling users to focus more on model development and less on data preprocessing.
