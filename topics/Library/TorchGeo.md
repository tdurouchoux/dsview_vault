TorchGeo is a PyTorch domain library designed for geospatial data, providing datasets, samplers, transforms, and pre-trained models. It aims to simplify the use of geospatial data for machine learning experts and remote sensing experts. The library supports various geospatial datasets, including multispectral imagery, and offers tools for sampling, data augmentation, and model training. It also includes benchmark datasets for tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. TorchGeo supports pre-trained weights for different multispectral sensors and integrates with PyTorch Lightning for reproducible training and evaluation.
