FreezeGun is a Python library used for testing code that depends on the current time. It allows developers to freeze and travel through time within their tests by mocking the datetime module, making it easier to test time-sensitive logic without waiting for actual time delays. This is particularly useful for unit testing functions that rely on the current date and time.
