FreezeGun is a Python library used for testing code that depends on the current time. It allows developers to freeze and travel through time in their tests by mocking the datetime module. This is particularly useful for testing functions that rely on the current date and time, ensuring that the tests are reproducible and not affected by the actual system time.
