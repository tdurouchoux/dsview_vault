Quivr-core is a library designed to facilitate the integration of Generative AI into applications. It provides an opinionated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework that is fast and efficient, allowing developers to focus on their product rather than the underlying RAG technology. Quivr-core supports various LLMs (Large Language Models) such as GPT4, Groq, and Llama, and can work with different vector stores like PGVector and Faiss. It also supports a wide range of file types and allows for customization of the RAG system.
