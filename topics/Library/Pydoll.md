Pydoll is a library for automating chromium-based browsers without a WebDriver, offering realistic interactions. It connects directly to the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP), eliminating the need for external drivers. It is designed to mimic real user behavior, making it practically indistinguishable from a real user. Pydoll focuses on simplicity and powerful automation without requiring deep expertise in configuration or dealing with bot protection systems.
