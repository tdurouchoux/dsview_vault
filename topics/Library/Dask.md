Dask is an open-source parallel computing library in Python that integrates seamlessly with existing Python ecosystems. It is designed to work with larger-than-memory datasets by breaking them into manageable chunks and processing them in parallel across multiple cores or distributed clusters. Dask provides two main components: a task scheduler and a high-level array data structure, enabling efficient and scalable data processing. It is particularly useful for tasks that involve large-scale data manipulation and analysis.
