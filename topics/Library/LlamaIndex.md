LlamaIndex is a data framework for connecting custom data sources to large language models (LLMs). It provides a simple and consistent interface for querying data from various sources, including APIs, databases, and files, and using it to augment the input of LLMs. LlamaIndex is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing users to easily add support for new data sources and customize the behavior of the framework to suit their specific needs.
