Tenacity is a Python library that provides a robust and flexible retrying mechanism for transient failures in distributed systems. It allows developers to configure retries with various options such as exponential backoff, jitter, and limiting the number of retries and total time. Tenacity supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, making it versatile for different use cases.
