Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing framework used for big data processing and analytics. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark is known for its in-memory processing capabilities, which significantly speed up data analytics tasks compared to traditional disk-based systems. It supports multiple languages, including Java, Scala, Python, and R, and offers libraries for SQL, machine learning, graph processing, and stream processing.
