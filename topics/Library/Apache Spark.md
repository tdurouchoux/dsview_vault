Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system used for big data processing and analytics. It provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Spark's in-memory computation and optimized query execution engine make it highly efficient for large-scale data processing tasks.
