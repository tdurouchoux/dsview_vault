PyMDE is a Python library that implements the Minimum Distortion Embedding (MDE) algorithm. It is used for generating embeddings from graphs or high-dimensional vectors. PyMDE provides preprocessing routines and can be configured to embed data into different dimensional spaces, making it a versatile tool for creating embeddings.
