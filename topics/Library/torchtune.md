Torchtune is a PyTorch library designed for post-training large language models (LLMs). It provides tools for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), knowledge distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and quantization-aware training. It supports various models like Llama, Gemma, Mistral, and more, with configurations for different training scenarios and hardware setups.
