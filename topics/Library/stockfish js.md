stockfish.js is a JavaScript port of Stockfish, a powerful open-source chess engine. It is designed to evaluate chess positions and suggest the best moves using advanced algorithms and heuristics. In the context of Probabilistic Chess, stockfish.js is used to provide move evaluations and suggestions, which are then integrated with the probabilistic elements of the game. The AI in Probabilistic Chess uses stockfish.js to determine the best moves based on traditional chess principles, while also considering the success probabilities of each move. This combination allows the AI to make strategic decisions that account for both the deterministic and probabilistic aspects of the game.
