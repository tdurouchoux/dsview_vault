bitnet.cpp is an official inference framework specifically designed for 1-bit LLMs, such as BitNet b1.58. It provides a suite of optimized kernels that support fast and lossless inference of 1.58-bit models on both CPU and GPU architectures. The framework is designed to enhance performance and reduce energy consumption, making it ideal for running large language models on local devices.
