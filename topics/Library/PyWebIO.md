PyWebIO is an open-source library for building simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. It provides functions to handle user input and output and supports integration with existing web services like Flask, Django, Tornado, aiohttp, and FastAPI frameworks. PyWebIO is ideal for creating basic data collection tools and calculators quickly. It is easy to set up and use but is not suited for complex applications, lacking the resources and community support available for more established frameworks.
