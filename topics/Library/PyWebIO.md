PyWebIO is an open-source library for building simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications. It provides functions to handle user input and output and supports integration with web services like Flask, Django, Tornado, aiohttp, and FastAPI frameworks. PyWebIO is designed for creating basic data collection tools and calculators. It is easy to set up and use, making it ideal for quick, no-frills web interfaces. However, it is not suitable for complex applications and has a smaller community with fewer resources available.
