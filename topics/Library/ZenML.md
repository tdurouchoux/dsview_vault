ZenML is a vendor-agnostic framework that facilitates the transition from experimental code to structured, production-ready machine learning pipelines. It allows decoupling application code from infrastructure tooling, supporting numerous integrations for additional functionality like feature stores, data validation, and experiment trackers. ZenML helps streamline the MLOps process, making it easier to manage and deploy machine learning models.
