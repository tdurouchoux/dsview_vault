Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets, providing features like schema evolution, hidden partitioning, and support for time travel. It is designed to address the limitations of traditional data lakes by adding table management capabilities, ensuring better data organization, and enabling efficient querying and updates. Iceberg uses a combination of JSON and Avro files to manage metadata and supports ACID transactions. PyIceberg is a Python library that provides bindings for the Apache Iceberg table format, allowing Python applications to read from and write to Iceberg tables, enabling efficient and scalable data management in big data environments.
