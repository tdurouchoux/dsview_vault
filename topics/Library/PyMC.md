PyMC is a probabilistic programming library for Python that allows users to build Bayesian models and perform Bayesian inference. It is widely used for statistical modeling and analysis, providing tools for defining complex models and sampling from their posterior distributions. PyMC-Extras is a module within the PyMC ecosystem that specializes in structural time series modeling based on state space representations. It provides building blocks that can be combined to create custom models tailored to specific needs, including local linear trend, seasonal components, regression components, and cycle components. PyMC-Extras relies on an efficient Kalman filter algorithm for state estimation and likelihood calculation, facilitating the incorporation of domain knowledge and providing a unified Bayesian framework for time series forecasting.
