Pfuzzer is a Python Fuzzy Searcher that leverages the Rust Nucleo library for fast and efficient fuzzy search capabilities. It allows users to perform imprecise searches by comparing strings and returning similarity scores. Pfuzzer demonstrates the integration of Rust's performance and safety with Python's flexibility through the PyO3 framework.
