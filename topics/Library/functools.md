The functools module in Python is a part of the standard library that provides higher-order functions for operations on callable objects. It includes utilities such as partial function application, memoization (caching), and tools for working with iterators. The cache decorator in functools is particularly useful for optimizing functions that are called repeatedly with the same arguments by storing their results.
