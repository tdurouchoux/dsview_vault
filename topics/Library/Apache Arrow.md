Apache Arrow is an open-source project that provides a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It includes a standardized memory format for flat and hierarchical data, optimized for efficient data processing and interchange. Arrow is designed to accelerate analytics by reducing data copying and serialization overhead, making it ideal for high-performance data processing frameworks and applications. PyArrow is a Python library that provides a high-level interface to the Apache Arrow project. It is used for reading and writing Parquet files, which are columnar storage files that can efficiently store and retrieve nested data like text embeddings.
