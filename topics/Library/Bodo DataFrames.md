Bodo DataFrames is a library designed to be a drop-in replacement for Pandas, offering optimized and parallelized data processing capabilities. It aims to enhance performance by automatically optimizing and parallelizing code where possible, falling back to Pandas seamlessly when certain APIs are not yet supported. This library is particularly useful for handling large datasets efficiently.
