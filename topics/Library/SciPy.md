SciPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It builds on NumPy and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines, such as routines for optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebra, statistics, and many special functions. It includes the `scipy.optimize` module used for optimization tasks.
