StellarGraph is a Python library designed for machine learning on graphs and networks. It offers state-of-the-art algorithms for various machine learning tasks such as representation learning for nodes and edges, node and edge classification, graph classification, link prediction, and interpretation of node classification. The library supports different types of graphs, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and knowledge graphs, with or without node attributes and edge weights. StellarGraph is built on TensorFlow 2 and its Keras high-level API, as well as Pandas and NumPy, making it user-friendly, modular, and extensible. It interoperates smoothly with other libraries like scikit-learn and can be easily installed with pip or Anaconda.
