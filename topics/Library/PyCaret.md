PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle and enhances productivity. PyCaret acts as a wrapper around several machine learning libraries and frameworks, including scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray. It simplifies complex machine learning tasks by reducing hundreds of lines of code to just a few lines, making experiments faster and more efficient.
