Quivr is a Python library designed to simplify the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) into applications. It provides an opinionated, fast, and efficient RAG implementation that allows developers to focus on their product rather than the underlying RAG mechanics. Quivr supports various large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Groq, and Llama, and can work with different vector stores like PGVector and Faiss. It also supports a wide range of file types and offers customization options for integrating internet search and other tools.
