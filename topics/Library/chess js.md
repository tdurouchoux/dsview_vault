chess.js is a JavaScript library designed to handle chess rules and logic. It provides functionalities for representing chess boards, making moves, detecting check, checkmate, and other game states, and generating valid moves. In the context of Probabilistic Chess, chess.js is used to manage the basic chess rules and logic, while additional probabilistic elements are layered on top. This library is essential for implementing the core mechanics of the game and ensuring that the moves adhere to standard chess rules, modified by the probabilistic elements introduced in this variant.
