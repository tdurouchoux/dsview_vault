PyApp is a utility library that simplifies the distribution and installation of Python applications. It embeds Python within a self-installing package compatible across all operating systems, supports self-updating capabilities, and allows for easy specification of dependencies via requirements.txt files. PyApp creates a dedicated directory for Python and the app's required dependencies, optimizing command-line interface responsiveness.
