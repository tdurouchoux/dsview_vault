A library for generating low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) by extracting the dominant color from an image or rendering a BlurHash value. It can render BlurHash to CSS gradients or a tiny BMP image data URI, typically around 150 bytes in size, to improve the appearance and reduce LCP time while images are loading.
