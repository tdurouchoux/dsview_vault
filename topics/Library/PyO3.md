PyO3 is a Rust framework that enables seamless integration of Rust code into Python. It provides a bridge between both languages, allowing Rust programs to be used as native Python modules. With PyO3, you can create Python APIs in Rust, integrate existing Rust libraries in Python, and call Python functions from Rust. The framework handles memory management, data structures, and interaction between runtimes of both languages.
