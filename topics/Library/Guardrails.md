Guardrails is a library designed to specify structure and type for large language models (LLMs), validating and correcting their outputs. It uses a .rail specification to define the structure of requested outputs, validators to ensure quality criteria, and corrective actions for non-compliant outputs. Guardrails helps make LLM applications more reliable and robust, facilitating easier integration into workflows.
