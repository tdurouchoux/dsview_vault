LMStudio is a tool for serving and interacting with language models locally. It allows users to download model weights from Hugging Face, import them into LMStudio, and serve the model locally. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model and can be used in conjunction with OpenHands for a more comprehensive experience.
