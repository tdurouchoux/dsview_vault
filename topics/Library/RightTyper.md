A productivity tool that automatically generates type hints for function arguments and return values in Python programs. It runs your code, observes its execution, and generates precise type annotations without significantly slowing down execution or consuming extra memory. RightTyper supports shape annotations for tensors in scientific computing and machine learning libraries like NumPy, JAX, and PyTorch, and includes functionality to compute type coverage for your codebase.
