FireDucks is a high-performance library designed to significantly speed up data processing tasks typically handled by Pandas. Developed by a team from NEC Corporation with extensive experience in supercomputing, FireDucks leverages the C engine to achieve remarkable performance improvements. It is notable for its compatibility with existing Pandas code, requiring zero changes to the codebase while providing substantial speed enhancements, often outperforming both Pandas and Polars in benchmarks.
