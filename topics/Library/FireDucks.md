FireDucks is a high-performance library designed to significantly speed up data processing tasks typically handled by Pandas. Developed by a team from NEC Corporation with extensive experience in supercomputing, FireDucks leverages the C engine to achieve remarkable performance improvements. It is fully compatible with existing Pandas code, requiring no modifications to the codebase, and has been benchmarked to be on average 50x faster than Pandas and even faster than Polars in certain tasks. This makes it an attractive option for data scientists looking to optimize their workflows without the need for extensive code refactoring.
