all/Ance (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah) is a C++/Python library designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of approximate nearest neighbor search. It is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces where exact nearest neighbor searches are computationally expensive. The library leverages advanced indexing and search algorithms to provide fast and accurate results, making it a valuable tool for applications in machine learning, data mining, and information retrieval.
