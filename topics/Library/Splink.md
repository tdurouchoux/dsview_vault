Splink is a Python package designed for data linking and deduplication at scale. It is known for its speed, accuracy, and scalability, capable of linking millions of records efficiently. The tool supports various operating systems and cloud providers, and it operates in environments with or without internet connectivity. Splink uses unsupervised learning, meaning it does not require training data, and it provides interactive outputs to help users understand and diagnose linkage problems. It has been widely adopted in government, private sector, academia, and charities for improving data quality and insights.
