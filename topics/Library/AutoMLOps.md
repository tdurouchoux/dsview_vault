AutoMLOps is a tool designed to alleviate the complexities of setting up effective MLOps pipelines. It annotates model development code as components and pipelines, automatically generating the necessary code to containerize components, provision them to Googleâ€™s cloud, and deploy those containers to the allocated resources. It follows an automated, reproducible CI/CD process that helps accelerate the path towards MLOps maturity level 2.
