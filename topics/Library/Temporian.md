Temporian is a library developed in partnership with Google for preprocessing and feature engineering of temporal data. It supports multivariate time-series, time-sequences, event logs, and cross-source event streams. Temporian's EventSet contains timestamped records with feature values, and it offers operators like lag, resample, and window functions for efficient data manipulation. The library is optimized for speed and ease of use, making it a powerful tool for working with temporal data.
