Temporian is a library for preprocessing and feature engineering of temporal data. It supports multivariate time-series, multivariate time-sequences, event logs, and cross-source event streams. Temporian's core computations are highly optimized, enabling safer, simpler, and much faster execution of temporal operations compared to general data preprocessing tools like pandas.
