Logging is like writing notes while your program runs. Instead of just printing things to the screen, you write them to a log. It helps you keep track of what your program is doing, especially when things go wrong. You can configure logging to control the level of detail in log messages and specify where the logs should go. This could be the console, a file, or other destinations.
