Ossification in robotics refers to the phenomenon where smaller models struggle to absorb complex and diverse sensorimotor data during pretraining, leading to a phase where model weights become unable to absorb new information. This has been observed in GEN-0 models under data overload, where larger models continue to improve while smaller ones exhibit ossification.
