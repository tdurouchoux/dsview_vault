Code review is a form of peer review where a reviewer examines the code written by another person to identify potential issues, suggest improvements, and provide feedback. It is a critical part of the software development process, ensuring code quality, knowledge transfer, and collaboration among team members. Effective code review helps catch bugs early, ensures code maintainability, and promotes adherence to coding standards and best practices.
