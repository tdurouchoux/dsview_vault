Dictionary learning is a machine learning technique used to discover a set of basis elements (or features) that can represent the data efficiently. In the context of interpretability, dictionary learning is applied to the activations of a model to decompose them into a linear combination of sparse features. This process helps in identifying interpretable features that correspond to specific concepts or behaviors in the model. Dictionary learning is a key method for scaling interpretability to larger models and understanding the underlying structure of the model's activations.
