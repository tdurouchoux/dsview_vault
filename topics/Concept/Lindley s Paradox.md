Lindley's Paradox illustrates a scenario where a p-value just below a common significance threshold (e.g., 0.05) can be more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis, especially with high statistical power. This paradox highlights the limitations of p-values as measures of evidence and the importance of considering the statistical power of a test. It underscores the need for alternative statistical approaches, such as Bayesian methods, to provide a more accurate assessment of evidence.
