A phenomenon in the field of natural language processing where there is a rapid development and proliferation of benchmarksâ€”standardized tests used to measure progress and performance of models. This boom is characterized by researchers creating new benchmarks to evaluate the capabilities of language models, particularly transformers, leading to a competitive environment where models are continuously tested and improved against these benchmarks.
