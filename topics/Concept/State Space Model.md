A state space model is a mathematical framework used to represent the dynamics of a system in terms of its state variables, which evolve over time according to specific rules. It is particularly useful in time series analysis and control theory, where the model describes how the state of a system transitions from one point to another and how observations are generated from the state variables. The model typically consists of two main components: the state equation, which governs the evolution of the state variables, and the observation equation, which relates the state variables to the observed data. State space models are widely used in various fields, including economics, engineering, and environmental science, for forecasting, filtering, and control purposes. State space models (SSMs) provide a powerful and flexible framework for time series forecasting, capable of handling complex dynamics such as time-varying trends, multiple seasonality patterns, and the influence of external regressors. These models decompose the time series into distinct, understandable components, making it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders. State space models are particularly useful for their interpretability and ability to incorporate domain knowledge through informative priors on the variance parameters.
