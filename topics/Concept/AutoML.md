AutoML, or Automated Machine Learning, refers to the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. It encompasses various techniques and tools designed to streamline the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. AutoML aims to make machine learning more accessible to non-experts and to accelerate the development of machine learning models by reducing the need for manual intervention and expertise.
