Time-Series Clustering is the process of grouping similar time-series data points into clusters based on their temporal patterns. This involves using clustering algorithms to identify groups of time series that exhibit similar behavior over time. Common clustering algorithms include k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Time-series clustering is used in various applications, such as customer segmentation, medical diagnosis, and environmental monitoring, to analyze and interpret complex temporal data.
