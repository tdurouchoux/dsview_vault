Union-Find is an algorithm used to efficiently manage and compute the connected components of a graph. It uses a data structure that maintains a partition of a set into disjoint subsets, allowing for efficient merging of subsets (union) and finding the subset to which an element belongs (find). The algorithm is widely used in various graph-related problems and is known for its efficiency and simplicity.
