Union-Find, also known as the Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a data structure that efficiently manages and manipulates sets of elements. It supports two primary operations: union, which merges two sets, and find, which determines the root of the set containing a given element. Union-Find is widely used in graph algorithms, such as Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree, and in network connectivity problems.
