A Python named tuple is a subclass of a regular tuple that allows for accessing tuple elements by name rather than by index. Named tuples are created using the 'collections.namedtuple' factory function and provide a convenient way to define lightweight, immutable data structures. They are useful for improving code readability and maintaining data integrity.
