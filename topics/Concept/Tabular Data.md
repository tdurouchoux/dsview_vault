Tabular data refers to data organized in a table format with rows and columns, where each row typically represents an observation and each column represents a feature or variable. This type of data is common in databases, spreadsheets, and CSV files. Tabular data is often used in machine learning for tasks such as classification and regression, where the goal is to predict a target variable based on the input features.
