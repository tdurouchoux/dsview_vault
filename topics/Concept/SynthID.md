SynthID is a technology developed by Google DeepMind designed to identify AI-generated content by embedding digital watermarks directly into AI-generated images, audio, text, or video. This technology helps manage the risk of misuse of generative AI, particularly in preventing misinformation and misattribution. SynthID uses deep learning models and algorithms to detect watermarked content, providing a tool for developers to ensure the transparency and traceability of AI-generated outputs. By open-sourcing SynthID, Google aims to promote the responsible use of AI and enhance the ecosystem's ability to manage AI-generated content effectively.
