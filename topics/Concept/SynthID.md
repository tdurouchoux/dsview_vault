SynthID is a technology developed by Google DeepMind to identify AI-generated content by embedding digital watermarks in text, images, audio, and video. It helps in detecting and managing the risk of misuse of generative AI, particularly in combating misinformation and misattribution. SynthID uses deep learning models and algorithms to embed and detect these watermarks, ensuring transparency and accountability in AI-generated content.
