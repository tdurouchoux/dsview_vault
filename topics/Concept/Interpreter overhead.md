Interpreter overhead refers to the additional computational cost incurred when executing code in an interpreted language compared to a compiled language. This overhead can include the time taken for the interpreter to parse and execute each line of code, as well as the lack of certain optimizations that are available in compiled languages. In the context of Python, interpreter overhead can significantly impact performance, especially in CPU-bound tasks.
