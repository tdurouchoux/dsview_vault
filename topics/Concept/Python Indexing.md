Python indexing is the process of accessing individual elements of a sequence by their position or index. Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning that the first element of a sequence has an index of 0. Indexing allows for the selection and manipulation of specific elements within a sequence, and is a fundamental operation in Python programming.
