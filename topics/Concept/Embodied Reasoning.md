Embodied reasoning refers to the ability of AI systems to understand and interact with the physical world through reasoning and planning. This involves using sensory inputs, language understanding, and decision-making capabilities to perform tasks autonomously. Embodied reasoning models are designed to handle complex, real-world scenarios by creating detailed plans and executing actions in a coordinated manner.
