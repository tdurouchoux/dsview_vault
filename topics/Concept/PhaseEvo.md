PhaseEvo is a recent technique that combines direct 'text gradient' approaches with more 'global' or lateral updates. It works in phases, generating diverse initial prompts, applying prompt gradients to the best performers, creating new variants through paraphrasing, and combining successful prompts to capture their best elements. This method helps overcome local optima and encourages further exploration.
