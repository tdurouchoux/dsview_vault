Structural Pattern Matching in Python, introduced in Python 3.10, provides a powerful way to match and destructure data based on its structure. It allows you to write more concise and readable code by eliminating the need for complex conditional statements. Pattern matching is particularly useful for handling complex data structures, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries, and for implementing state machines or parsing data.
