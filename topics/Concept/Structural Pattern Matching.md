Structural Pattern Matching in Python, introduced in Python 3.10, allows developers to match and destructure data based on patterns. Using the match-case syntax, developers can handle complex data structures and extract values in a single step. This feature supports guard clauses, OR patterns, and collection matching, providing a powerful alternative to traditional conditional logic and enhancing code readability.
