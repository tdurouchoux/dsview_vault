Safety-relevant features are features in a model that are plausibly connected to potential safety concerns or harmful behaviors. These features may activate on topics such as security vulnerabilities, bias, deception, power-seeking, sycophancy, and dangerous or criminal content. Safety-relevant features are of particular interest because they may indicate the model's capacity to cause harm or engage in unsafe behaviors. Understanding and monitoring these features is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of the model, as well as for developing strategies to mitigate potential risks.
