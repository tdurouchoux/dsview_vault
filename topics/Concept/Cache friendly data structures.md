Cache-friendly data structures are designed to maximize the efficiency of CPU caching by organizing data in a way that minimizes cache misses. This often involves ensuring that data is accessed in a sequential manner and that related data is stored close together in memory. In languages like Python, where direct control over memory layout is limited, achieving cache-friendly data structures can be more challenging.
