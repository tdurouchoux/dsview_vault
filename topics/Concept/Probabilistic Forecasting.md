Probabilistic forecasting is a method that generates complete probability distributions over possible future outcomes rather than single-point predictions. This approach provides decision-makers with a comprehensive view of potential scenarios, enabling robust planning that accounts for risk and uncertainty. It is particularly useful in business planning across industries such as retail inventory management, financial market analysis, energy demand prediction, and marketing budget allocation.
