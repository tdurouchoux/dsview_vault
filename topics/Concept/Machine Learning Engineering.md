Machine Learning Engineering refers to the application of software engineering principles and practices to the development and deployment of machine learning models. It involves creating scalable, maintainable, and robust systems that can handle large-scale data processing, model training, and real-time inference. This field emphasizes the importance of understanding the entire lifecycle of a machine learning system, from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring. It also focuses on best practices for ensuring the reliability, performance, and scalability of machine learning systems in production environments.
