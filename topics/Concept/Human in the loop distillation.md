Human-in-the-loop distillation is a process in machine learning where human expertise is integrated into the model training and refinement process. This approach involves humans providing feedback and annotations to improve the model's performance. The goal is to create smaller, faster, and more accurate models that are tailored to specific tasks. Human-in-the-loop distillation helps in producing models that are more reliable and better suited for real-world applications.
