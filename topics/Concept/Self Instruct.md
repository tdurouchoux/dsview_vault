Self-Instruct is a technique where a language model generates its own instruction data for training. This involves the model creating a diverse set of instructions and corresponding outputs, which are then used to fine-tune the model. Self-Instruct aims to improve the model's ability to follow instructions and perform tasks more accurately and efficiently. This method reduces the need for human-generated instruction data and allows the model to learn from a broader range of scenarios.
