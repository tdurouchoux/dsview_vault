Total Ionizing Dose (TID) is a measure of the cumulative radiation exposure that a material or electronic component receives over time. In the context of space-based systems, TID is a critical factor in assessing the radiation tolerance of components such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Understanding and mitigating the effects of TID is essential for ensuring the reliability and longevity of electronic systems operating in the harsh radiation environment of space.
