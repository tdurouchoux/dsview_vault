Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications in lightweight, portable containers. Containers allow developers to package applications with their dependencies and configurations into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring consistency across different computing environments. Docker simplifies the process of developing, shipping, and running applications, making it a popular tool in DevOps and cloud computing.
