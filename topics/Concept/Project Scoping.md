Project scoping is the process of defining the boundaries, objectives, and deliverables of a project. In data science, scoping involves assessing the potential impact and return on investment (ROI) of a project, identifying existing solutions, and determining the feasibility of the project. Proper scoping helps in prioritizing projects, avoiding low-impact initiatives, and ensuring that the project aligns with business goals.
