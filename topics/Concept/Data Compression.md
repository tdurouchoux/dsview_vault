Data compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than an unencoded representation would use. It is widely used to reduce the size of data files, making them easier to store and transmit. In the context of Parquet files, data compression is used to reduce the size of the data while maintaining the ability to query it efficiently. Common compression algorithms include Snappy and zstd.
