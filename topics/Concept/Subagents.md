Subagents in Claude Code are specialized agents designed to handle specific tasks within a larger project. They help manage context by delegating complex tasks to focused agents, which can reduce the token usage in the main context window. However, they can also create context gatekeeping and force rigid workflows, which might not always be optimal for dynamic task management.
