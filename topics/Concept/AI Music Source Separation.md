AI Music Source Separation is a technique that uses artificial intelligence to decompose an audio track into its individual components, such as vocals, instruments, and background noise. This process involves advanced algorithms that can identify and isolate different sounds within a complex audio signal. The challenge lies in accurately distinguishing between overlapping sounds and maintaining high audio quality in the separated tracks. This technology is particularly useful in music production, audio restoration, and creating karaoke tracks.
