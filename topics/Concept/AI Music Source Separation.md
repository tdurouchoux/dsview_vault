AI Music Source Separation is a technique that uses artificial intelligence to isolate individual audio sources from a mixed audio signal. This process involves advanced algorithms and machine learning models to distinguish between different instruments, vocals, and other sound elements within a music track. The goal is to extract each component so that they can be manipulated or analyzed separately. This technology is particularly challenging due to the complexity of audio signals and the need for high accuracy in separating overlapping sounds.
