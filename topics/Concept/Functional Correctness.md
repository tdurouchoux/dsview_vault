Functional correctness is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of code generated by a model, particularly in natural language-to-code (NL2Code) tasks. It assesses whether the generated code produces the desired output for a given input. Functional correctness evaluation involves defining a set of test cases that cover different inputs and their expected outputs. The generated code is then executed, and its output is compared to the expected output. If the generated output matches the expected output for each input, the test case is considered to have passed, and the code is deemed functionally correct. However, functional correctness evaluation has limitations, such as the cost of setting up an execution environment and the difficulty of defining a comprehensive set of test cases.
