Functional correctness is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of code generated by a language model or other automated system. It assesses whether the generated code produces the desired output for a given input, ensuring that the code functions as intended. Functional correctness evaluation involves defining a set of test cases that cover different inputs and their expected outputs. The generated code is then tested against these cases to determine if it produces the correct results. While functional correctness is a crucial metric for evaluating the performance of code generation models, it has limitations, such as the cost of setting up an execution environment and the difficulty of defining comprehensive test cases that cover all possible inputs and edge cases.
