Multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents interacting within the same environment, each learning to maximize their own rewards. This field studies how agents can learn to cooperate, compete, or act in a mixed-manner, often leading to complex dynamics and emergent behaviors. Applications include robotics, autonomous vehicles, and game playing.
