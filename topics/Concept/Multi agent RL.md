Multi-agent reinforcement learning involves multiple agents learning and interacting within the same environment. This field focuses on understanding how agents can learn to cooperate, compete, or negotiate with each other. Techniques like Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Systems (RL-MAS) are examples of multi-agent RL.
