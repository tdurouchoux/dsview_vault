High-Level Operations (HLO) are a representation used in machine learning compilers like XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). HLOs are designed to be a high-level, hardware-agnostic intermediate representation that can be efficiently implemented on various hardware platforms, including GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs. They aim to simplify the process of optimizing and porting machine learning models by reducing the number of operations that need to be directly supported by the hardware.
