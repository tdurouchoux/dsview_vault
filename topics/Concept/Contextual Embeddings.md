Contextual Embeddings is a sub-technique of Contextual Retrieval that involves adding chunk-specific explanatory context to each chunk before embedding. This helps in preserving the context of the chunks, making the retrieval process more accurate and effective. For example, a chunk from an SEC filing about a company's revenue growth is contextualized with information about the company and the relevant time period, making it easier to retrieve the right information.
