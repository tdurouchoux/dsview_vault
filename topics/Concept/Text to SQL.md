Text-to-SQL is a natural language processing technique that converts natural language queries into SQL queries, enabling users to interact with databases using plain English or other natural languages. This technology bridges the gap between non-technical users and complex database systems, making it easier to retrieve data without requiring extensive SQL knowledge. Text-to-SQL systems typically use machine learning models trained on datasets of question-SQL query pairs to understand and generate the appropriate SQL commands.
