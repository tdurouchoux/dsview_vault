Text-to-SQL is a natural language processing technique that converts natural language queries into SQL queries, enabling users to interact with databases using plain English or other natural languages. This technology bridges the gap between non-technical users and complex database systems, making data access and querying more intuitive and efficient. Text-to-SQL systems typically use machine learning models trained on large datasets of question-SQL query pairs to understand the intent behind a natural language question and generate the corresponding SQL query.
