A method of retrieving files based on their semantic content rather than just keywords or metadata. This approach uses vector databases and embedding vectors to store and retrieve files, allowing for more accurate and context-aware file searches. Semantic file retrieval improves the ability to find relevant files even when they contain similar content but different keywords.
