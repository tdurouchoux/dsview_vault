Frequentist statistics is a framework for statistical inference that focuses on the frequency of events under repeated sampling. It relies on fixed parameters and uses data to make inferences about these parameters. This approach is widely used in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and other statistical methods. Frequentist methods are often contrasted with Bayesian methods, which incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs using data.
