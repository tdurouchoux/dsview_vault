Multi-GPU autoscaling is a feature that allows systems to automatically adjust the number of GPUs used based on the current workload. This ensures efficient resource utilization and optimal performance by scaling up or down the number of GPUs as needed. It is particularly useful in handling variable workloads and maintaining high performance in AI applications.
