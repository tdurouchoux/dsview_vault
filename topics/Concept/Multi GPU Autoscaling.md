Multi-GPU autoscaling is a concept that involves automatically adjusting the number of GPUs used in a system based on the current workload. This allows for efficient resource utilization and can significantly improve the performance of AI models, especially those that require substantial computational power. It is particularly useful in environments where the workload can vary significantly over time.
