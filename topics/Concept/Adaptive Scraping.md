Adaptive Scraping is a technique used by Scrapling to relocate elements on a webpage after changes to the website's structure. This is achieved using intelligent similarity algorithms that help maintain the functionality of scrapers even when the website's design or structure changes. It ensures that scrapers can continue to extract data accurately despite updates to the target website.
