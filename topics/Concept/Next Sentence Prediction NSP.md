Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) is a pre-training task used in BERT that jointly pre-trains text-pair representations. It involves predicting whether a second sentence is the actual next sentence that follows the first sentence or a random sentence from the corpus. This task helps the model understand the relationship between two sentences, which is beneficial for tasks like question answering and natural language inference.
