Span categorization is the process of identifying and classifying specific segments or spans of text within a document. This involves labeling different parts of the text with relevant categories or tags, which helps in organizing and extracting information more efficiently. Span categorization is often used in conjunction with other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, to improve the accuracy and relevance of the extracted data.
