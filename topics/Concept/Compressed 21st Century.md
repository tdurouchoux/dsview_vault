The concept of the 'Compressed 21st Century' refers to the idea that advancements in biology and medicine, driven by powerful AI, could accelerate progress to such an extent that the developments typically expected over a century could be achieved within a much shorter timeframe, potentially within 5-10 years. This acceleration is envisioned to bring about significant improvements in health, longevity, and quality of life, effectively condensing the progress of a century into a few years. The concept highlights the transformative potential of AI in rapidly advancing scientific and medical breakthroughs, leading to unprecedented improvements in human well-being.
