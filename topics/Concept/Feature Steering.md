Feature steering is a technique used to modify the activations of specific features in a model during a forward pass to influence the model's behavior. This technique involves clamping the activations of features to specific values to observe their effects on the model's outputs. Feature steering is used to demonstrate the causal relevance of features and to explore their influence on the model's behavior. It is a powerful tool for understanding the role of features in the model's decision-making process and for steering the model towards desired behaviors.
