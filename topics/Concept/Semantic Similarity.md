Semantic similarity refers to the degree to which two pieces of text or other data have similar meanings. It is a measure of how closely related the semantic content of two pieces of data is, regardless of their surface-level differences. Semantic similarity is often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to compare the meaning of sentences, phrases, or words. It can be calculated using various methods, such as cosine similarity between word embeddings, which represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space. Semantic similarity is crucial for tasks like text classification, information retrieval, and machine translation, where understanding the meaning of text is essential for accurate and effective processing.
