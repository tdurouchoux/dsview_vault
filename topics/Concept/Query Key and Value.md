In the attention mechanism, queries, keys, and values are vectors derived from the input embeddings. Queries represent the current token's context, keys represent potential matches or answers, and values contain the actual information to be used in updating the embeddings. The interaction between these vectors determines how information is weighted and updated in the model.
