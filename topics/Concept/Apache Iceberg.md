Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets that supports ACID transactions, schema evolution, and partition evolution. It is designed to address the limitations of traditional data lakes by providing a more structured and manageable approach to data storage and retrieval. Iceberg uses a combination of metadata files and a catalog service to manage table data and ensure consistency.
