The Tech Assistant Prompt is a specific prompt designed to enable models like StarCoder to act as technical assistants. Inspired by Anthropic's HHH prompt, it allows the model to answer programming-related requests and provide assistance based on its training on documentation and GitHub issues. This prompt leverages the model's capabilities to interact with users in a conversational manner, providing technical support and solutions to programming problems.
