High-Level Operation (HLO) is a representation used in machine learning compilers, such as XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra), to optimize and execute computation graphs efficiently. HLO operations are designed to be implementable on various hardware platforms, including GPUs, CPUs, and TPUs. They serve as an intermediate representation that abstracts away the complexities of low-level operations, allowing for better portability and performance optimization of machine learning models.
