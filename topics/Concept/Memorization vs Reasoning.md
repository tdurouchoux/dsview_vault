Memorization and reasoning are two different approaches to problem-solving in AI. Memorization involves storing and retrieving large amounts of data or patterns to solve tasks, which is efficient for tasks that are similar to those seen during training. Reasoning, on the other hand, involves synthesizing new solutions on the fly, which is necessary for tasks that require adaptation and generalization to novel situations. The distinction between these two approaches is crucial for evaluating the capabilities of AI models and their potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).
