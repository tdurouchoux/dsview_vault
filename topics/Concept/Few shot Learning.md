Few-shot learning is a machine learning paradigm where models are trained to make accurate predictions given only a few examples, often leveraging pre-trained models or meta-learning techniques. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. Few-shot learning enables models to generalize from limited data, making it a valuable technique in various applications, including natural language processing and computer vision.
