Slurm is a workload manager designed for Linux clusters. It is commonly used in high-performance computing (HPC) environments to manage and allocate resources for parallel processing tasks. Slurm provides features for job scheduling, resource management, and job monitoring, making it suitable for running large-scale data processing pipelines on clusters. In the context of DataTrove, Slurm is used to launch and manage pipeline executions on slurm clusters, utilizing slurm job arrays to group and manage tasks.
