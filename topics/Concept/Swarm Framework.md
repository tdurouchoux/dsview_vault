Swarm Framework is an educational framework developed by OpenAI for exploring lightweight multi-agent orchestration. It provides tools and abstractions for creating and managing agents that can coordinate and execute tasks. The framework focuses on making agent coordination highly controllable, easily testable, and scalable, allowing developers to build real-world solutions with minimal complexity.
