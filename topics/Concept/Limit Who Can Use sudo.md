Limiting who can use sudo involves restricting the use of the sudo command to specific users or groups. This is done by editing the sudoers file to specify which users or groups are allowed to execute commands with root privileges. By default, all users in the sudo group can use sudo, but this can be changed to restrict access to a smaller group of trusted users. This measure helps to prevent unauthorized users from gaining root access and making system-wide changes.
