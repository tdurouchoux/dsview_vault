Hierarchical reinforcement learning aims to decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks or options, allowing the agent to learn a hierarchy of policies. This approach can improve sample efficiency and enable the agent to handle more complex and long-horizon tasks by breaking them down into manageable parts.
