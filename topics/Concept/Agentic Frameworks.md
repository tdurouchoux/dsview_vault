Agentic frameworks are structures that enable AI agents to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These frameworks can vary, such as LangChain and CrewAI, and are used to build agents that can reason, gather information, and make predictions. The performance of these frameworks can be compared by keeping the underlying models and tools constant.
