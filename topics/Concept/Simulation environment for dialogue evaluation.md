The simulation environment for dialogue evaluation is a comprehensive framework developed to enable rapid iteration and robust automated assessment of the AMIE system. This environment generates realistic patient scenarios, including detailed profiles and multimodal artifacts derived from datasets like PTB-XL and SCIN, augmented with plausible clinical context using Gemini models and web search. It simulates turn-by-turn multimodal dialogues between AMIE and patient agents, adhering to the scenario, and evaluates these dialogues using an auto-rater agent against predefined clinical criteria. This framework supports the continuous improvement of AMIE's diagnostic capabilities and ensures its performance is rigorously validated.
