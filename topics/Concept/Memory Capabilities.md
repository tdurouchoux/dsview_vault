Memory capabilities in Claude 4 models refer to their ability to extract and save key facts from local files when given access by developers. This feature allows the models to maintain continuity and build tacit knowledge over time, improving their performance on long-term tasks and enhancing their ability to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses.
