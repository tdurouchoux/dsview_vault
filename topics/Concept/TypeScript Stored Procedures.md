TypeScript stored procedures refer to the use of TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, to write stored procedures in databases. Stored procedures are precompiled collections of SQL statements and procedural logic that can be executed on a database server. Using TypeScript for stored procedures can enhance code reliability and maintainability, leveraging modern programming features and type safety.
