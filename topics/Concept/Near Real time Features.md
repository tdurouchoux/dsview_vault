Near real-time features are precomputed using streaming processing engines and are recomputed frequently to ensure data freshness. They offer a balance between batch features and real-time features, providing fresh data without the scalability issues of real-time features. Near real-time features are computed asynchronously, reducing feature staleness and avoiding wasted computation.
