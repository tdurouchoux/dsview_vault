Open-source tools for RLHF are software libraries and frameworks that provide implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms and other utilities for fine-tuning language models using human feedback. These tools enable researchers and practitioners to experiment with RLHF and develop new applications of this technique. Examples of open-source tools for RLHF include Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL), TRLX, and Reinforcement Learning for Language Models (RL4LMs).
