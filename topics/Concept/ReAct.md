ReAct is a prompting framework that combines reasoning and acting steps to improve the performance of language models on complex tasks. It involves alternating between reasoning steps, where the model generates intermediate thoughts or plans, and acting steps, where the model takes specific actions based on those thoughts, leading to more accurate and effective task completion.
