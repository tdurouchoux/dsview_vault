Data Integration as Code is a method of defining data integration processes using code, typically through declarative configurations. This approach allows for the creation of data pipelines and infrastructure in a manner that is version-controlled, reproducible, and easily manageable. Tools like Airbyte and Dagster enable the declarative creation of sources and destinations, making it easier to integrate data from various sources into a cohesive data stack.
