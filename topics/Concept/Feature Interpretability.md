Feature interpretability refers to the ability to understand and explain the meaning and function of individual features in a model. In the context of interpretability, feature interpretability involves analyzing the activations of features to determine what concepts or behaviors they represent and how they influence the model's outputs. This process includes assessing the specificity and influence of features, as well as using automated interpretability methods to provide explanations and predictions. Feature interpretability is crucial for gaining insights into the model's behavior and ensuring that the extracted features are meaningful and useful.
