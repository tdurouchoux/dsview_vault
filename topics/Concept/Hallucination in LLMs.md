Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the phenomenon where the model generates outputs that are not grounded in the provided context or its training data. This can result in the model producing incorrect, misleading, or fabricated information. Hallucinations are a significant challenge in the field of natural language processing, as they can undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of the model's outputs. Various strategies, such as fine-tuning and selective generation, are employed to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of LLM responses. Benchmarks like FACTS Grounding aim to evaluate and reduce such hallucinations.
