Hallucination in the context of language models refers to the phenomenon where the model generates outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely made up. This can occur due to various reasons, such as the model's training data, the complexity of the task, or the lack of sufficient context. Hallucinations can be problematic as they can lead to misleading or inaccurate information being presented as factual. Models like gpt-oss-safeguard are evaluated for their hallucination rates to assess their reliability and accuracy. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in state-of-the-art language models, which sometimes produce overconfident, plausible falsehoods. Hallucinations are a significant issue in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, as they can diminish the utility and trustworthiness of language models. The text discusses various factors contributing to hallucinations, including the training and evaluation procedures that reward guessing over acknowledging uncertainty. Hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the phenomenon where the model generates outputs that are not grounded in the provided context or its training data. This can result in the model producing incorrect, misleading, or fabricated information. Hallucinations are a significant challenge in the field of natural language processing, as they can undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of the model's outputs. Various strategies, such as fine-tuning and selective generation, are employed to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of LLM responses. Benchmarks like FACTS Grounding aim to evaluate and reduce such hallucinations.
