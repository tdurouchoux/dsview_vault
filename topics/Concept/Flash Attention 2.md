Flash Attention 2 is an optimized implementation of the attention mechanism used in transformer models. It is designed to improve the efficiency and performance of these models by reducing memory usage and speeding up computation. This implementation is used in models like SmolVLM2 to enhance their performance during inference and fine-tuning.
