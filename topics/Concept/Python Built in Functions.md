Python built-in functions are a set of functions that are always available in Python without the need for importing any modules. These functions perform common tasks such as type conversion, mathematical operations, and sequence manipulation. Examples include 'len()' for getting the length of an object, 'print()' for outputting text, and 'range()' for generating a sequence of numbers.
