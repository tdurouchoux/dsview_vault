Python built-in functions are a set of functions that are always available in Python without the need for any imports. These functions provide basic functionality and are used for various tasks such as type conversion, mathematical operations, sequence manipulation, and more. Examples of Python built-in functions include 'abs()', 'len()', 'type()', 'print()', 'range()', and 'help()'. These functions are part of the Python standard library and are essential for performing common operations in Python programs.
