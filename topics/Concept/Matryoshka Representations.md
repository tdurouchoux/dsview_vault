Matryoshka Representations refer to a technique in which embedding dimensions can be truncated as needed, providing flexibility in model size and performance. This approach allows for the use of different embedding dimensions depending on the specific requirements of the task, enabling efficient and scalable text processing. Matryoshka Representations are particularly useful in resource-constrained environments, where the ability to adjust the model size can significantly impact performance.
