The SSH Group for AllowGroups is a configuration setting in SSH that restricts SSH access to users who are members of a specific UNIX group. This setting is used in the SSH server configuration file (sshd_config) to specify which groups are allowed to access the server via SSH. By creating a group and adding users to it, administrators can easily manage SSH access permissions. This method enhances security by limiting SSH access to only authorized users.
