A feature platform is a core component of the MLOps stack that handles feature engineering, feature computation, and serving computed features for models to generate predictions. It supports both batch and online prediction and is designed to optimize feature computation and feature retrieval latency. Feature platforms are distinct from model platforms and feature stores, focusing on the entire feature engineering workflow.
