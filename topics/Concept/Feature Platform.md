A feature platform is a system designed to handle feature engineering, feature computation, and serving computed features for models to generate predictions. It aims to optimize feature computation and feature retrieval, reducing the time and effort required for data scientists to integrate new features into their models. Feature platforms can support both batch and online prediction, making them versatile for various use cases. They often include components like feature APIs, feature catalogs, computation engines, and feature stores.
