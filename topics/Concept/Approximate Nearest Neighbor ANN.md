Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a method used to find the nearest neighbors of a query vector in a high-dimensional space. Unlike exact nearest neighbor search, ANN trade-offs some accuracy for significant performance improvements, making it suitable for large-scale datasets where exact search would be computationally expensive. ANN techniques are widely used in applications like recommendation systems and semantic search.
