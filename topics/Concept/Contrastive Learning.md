Contrastive learning is a pre-training objective for vision models that aims to align images and texts to a joint feature space. It minimizes the distance between the embeddings of matching image-text pairs and maximizes the distance for non-matching pairs. Models like CLIP, CLOOB, ALIGN, and DeCLIP use contrastive learning to bridge vision and language modalities.
