Contrastive learning is a pre-training objective for vision models that aims to map input images and texts to the same feature space such that the distance between the embeddings of image-text pairs is minimized if they match or maximized if they donâ€™t. This approach has proven to be highly effective for vision-language models, enabling tasks like zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval.
