Text similarity metrics are evaluation methods used to measure the similarity between two texts. These metrics focus on computing the overlap of words or word sequences between text elements. Text similarity metrics are useful for producing a similarity score for predicted output from a model and reference ground truth text. They provide an indication of how well the model is performing for each respective task. Common text similarity metrics include the Levenshtein Similarity Ratio, which measures the similarity between two sequences based on the minimum number of single-character edits required to change one string into the other.
