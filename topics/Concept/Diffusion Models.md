Diffusion models are a class of generative models used for creating realistic synthetic content, such as images and videos. These models work by gradually adding noise to data and then learning to reverse this process to generate new samples. Diffusion models have gained popularity for their ability to produce high-quality, diverse outputs. They often utilize transformer-based architectures to enhance their generative capabilities, making them suitable for various applications, including image and video generation, as well as other forms of continuous media content.
