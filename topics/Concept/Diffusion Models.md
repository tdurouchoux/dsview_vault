Diffusion models are a class of generative models used for creating realistic synthetic content, such as images and videos. These models operate by gradually adding and removing noise from data to generate new samples. Diffusion models have gained prominence for their ability to produce high-quality, continuous media content. They typically employ architectures like UNet or transformers to learn the underlying data distribution. The models can be conditioned on various inputs to generate specific types of content, and recent advancements have focused on improving efficiency and exploring new applications, making them a key area of research in generative AI.
