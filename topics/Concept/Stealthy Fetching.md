Stealthy Fetching is a method employed by Scrapling to make HTTP requests that are designed to avoid detection by anti-bot systems. This involves impersonating browser TLS fingerprints, headers, and using advanced stealth capabilities to bypass anti-bot measures, such as Cloudflare's Turnstile. Stealthy Fetching ensures that web scrapers can access data without being blocked or detected.
