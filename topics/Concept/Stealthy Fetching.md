Stealthy Fetching is a method employed by Scrapling to bypass anti-bot systems and perform web scraping undetected. It involves using a modified version of Firefox with fingerprint spoofing capabilities. Stealthy Fetching can impersonate browser TLS fingerprints, headers, and use HTTP3 to avoid detection by advanced anti-bot systems like Cloudflare's Turnstile.
