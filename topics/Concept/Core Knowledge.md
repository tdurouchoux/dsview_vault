Core knowledge refers to the fundamental, basic understanding that any four or five-year-old possesses, including elementary physics, objectness, counting, and basic geometry. It is the foundational knowledge required to approach and solve problems in the ARC benchmark. Core knowledge is essential for both humans and machines to reason through novel tasks and puzzles, making it a critical component in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
