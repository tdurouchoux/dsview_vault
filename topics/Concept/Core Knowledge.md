Core knowledge refers to the basic, fundamental knowledge that any individual, including young children, possesses. This includes understanding of elementary physics, objectness, counting, geometry, topology, and symmetries. Core knowledge is essential for solving novel problems and is a key focus in the ARC benchmark, as it tests the ability of AI models to apply this basic knowledge to new, unseen tasks without relying on memorization.
