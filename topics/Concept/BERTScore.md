BERTScore is a metric for evaluating the quality of text generation tasks, such as summarization and translation. It leverages pre-trained language models like BERT to compute the similarity between the embeddings of words in the candidate text and the reference text. By comparing these contextual embeddings, BERTScore captures semantic similarities that traditional n-gram-based metrics might miss, providing a more nuanced evaluation of text quality.
