Resolution rate is a metric used to determine the effectiveness of Bugbot in identifying and resolving bugs. It measures, at pull request merge time, which bugs were actually resolved by the author in the final code. This metric provides a clear signal of Bugbot's impact, directly answering whether it is finding real issues that engineers fix, and is prominently surfaced in the dashboard for teams to evaluate effectiveness.
