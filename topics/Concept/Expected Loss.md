Expected loss in decision theory is a measure of the potential negative outcomes associated with a decision, weighted by their probabilities. It helps in evaluating the risks and benefits of different actions and choosing the one that minimizes the expected loss. Expected loss is particularly useful in decision-making under uncertainty, where the outcomes of actions are not known with certainty.
