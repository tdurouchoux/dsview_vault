Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks designed to operate on graph-structured data. They leverage the structure and properties of graphs, where data is represented as nodes and edges, to perform various prediction tasks. GNNs have been developed to handle graph-level, node-level, and edge-level tasks, and have applications in areas such as molecular discovery, physics simulations, fake news detection, traffic prediction, and recommendation systems. They are built using components like message passing neural networks and graph nets architectures, and can be adapted to different types of graph data and attributes.
