Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), self-correction, pattern recognition, decision making, and problem-solving. AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. In the context of the article, the IA is used to create content from users' personal data, raising ethical and privacy questions.
