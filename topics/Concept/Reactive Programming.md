Reactive programming is a paradigm where the system automatically responds to changes in data or user interactions. In the context of Marimo, reactive programming ensures that when a cell is executed or a UI element is interacted with, all dependent cells are automatically updated or marked as stale. This approach helps maintain consistency in code and outputs, reducing the likelihood of bugs and hidden states.
