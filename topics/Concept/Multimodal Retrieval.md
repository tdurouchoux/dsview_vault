Multimodal retrieval involves the process of retrieving information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and other data types, to perform tasks like search and question answering. In the context of SmolVLM, multimodal retrieval is enhanced by the ColSmolVLM models, which are fine-tuned versions of SmolVLM that deliver state-of-the-art retrieval speeds and performance. These models make it faster and cheaper to build searchable databases, leveraging the efficiency of smaller VLMs.
