Active inference is a framework in cognitive science and AI that posits that intelligent agents actively seek information to reduce uncertainty about their environment. In the context of AI, active inference involves models that can adapt and learn on the fly, adjusting their internal states based on new information to better understand and solve tasks. This concept is crucial for developing AI systems that can handle novelty and uncertainty, as opposed to relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.
