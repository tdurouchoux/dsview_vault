Monosemanticity refers to the property of a feature or concept being associated with a single, clear meaning or interpretation. In the context of language models and interpretability, it suggests that individual features or neurons in a model should correspond to distinct, interpretable concepts, making the model's behavior more transparent and easier to understand. This approach aims to extract and analyze features that are monosemantic to gain insights into how the model processes and generates information.
