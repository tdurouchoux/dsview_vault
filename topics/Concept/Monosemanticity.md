Monosemanticity refers to the concept where each feature in a model, such as a neural network, corresponds to a single, clear meaning or concept. This is in contrast to polysemantic features, which can correspond to multiple meanings. In the context of the provided text, scaling monosemanticity involves extracting interpretable features from large models like Claude 3 Sonnet, ensuring that each feature is distinct and understandable. This approach helps in understanding and interpreting the behavior of complex models by breaking down their activations into more interpretable components.
