Open-source tools for RLHF are software libraries and frameworks that provide implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms and techniques for fine-tuning language models based on human feedback. These tools enable researchers and practitioners to experiment with RLHF and develop their own language models that are aligned with human values and preferences. Examples of open-source tools for RLHF include Transformers Reinforcement Learning (TRL), TRLX, and Reinforcement Learning for Language models (RL4LMs).
