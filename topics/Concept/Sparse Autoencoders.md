Sparse autoencoders are a type of neural network used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction. They aim to learn a compressed, sparse representation of the input data, where only a small number of features are active at any given time. In the context of interpretability, sparse autoencoders are used to decompose the activations of a model into more interpretable pieces, helping to identify and understand the underlying features and their roles in the model's behavior. This method is particularly useful for scaling interpretability to larger models and extracting meaningful, monosemantic features.
