Semantic SQL is an approach to SQL querying that represents business concepts in SQL queries, making complex data accessible without requiring technical database knowledge. It leverages abstract syntax trees (AST) to visualize and decipher the relationships, dependencies, and connections behind the queries. Semantic SQL enables features like automated dependency tracking and cross-dialect compatibility, making it easier for business users to access and understand data. This approach is essential for GenBI, as it provides the semantic context that AI models need to understand and generate BI artifacts.
