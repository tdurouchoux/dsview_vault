Semantic SQL is an approach to SQL querying that represents business concepts in SQL queries, making complex data accessible without requiring technical database knowledge. It involves using abstract syntax trees (AST) to visualize and decipher the relationships, dependencies, and connections behind the queries. Semantic SQL enables features like automated dependency tracking and cross-dialect compatibility, making it easier for business users to access and understand data.
