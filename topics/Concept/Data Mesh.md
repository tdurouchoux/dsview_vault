Data Mesh is a decentralized data architecture paradigm that treats data as a product and advocates for a domain-oriented, self-serve approach to data management. It emphasizes the importance of data as a product, owned by domain-oriented data teams, and promotes interoperability and scalability through standardized, self-serve infrastructure.
