Data Mesh is a decentralized data architecture paradigm that treats data as a product and promotes a domain-oriented, self-serve approach to data management. It aims to address the challenges of managing large-scale data in modern enterprises by aligning data ownership and architecture with organizational domains. Data Mesh emphasizes the use of data products, which are curated and managed by domain-specific teams, and leverages modern data technologies to enable data sharing and interoperability across the organization.
