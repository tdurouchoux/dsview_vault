Prompt injection attacks are a type of cyberattack where malicious actors attempt to manipulate AI models by smuggling deceptive instructions into the input prompts. These attacks aim to fool the model into exhibiting harmful or unintended behavior. Claude Opus 4.5 is designed to be robust against such attacks, making it harder to trick the model compared to other frontier models.
