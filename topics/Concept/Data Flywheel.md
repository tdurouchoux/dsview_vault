The data flywheel concept refers to a self-reinforcing cycle where data is used to improve a product or service, which in turn generates more data, leading to continuous improvement. This cycle is particularly relevant in machine learning and data-driven applications, where the quality and quantity of data directly impact the performance of models. The data flywheel emphasizes the importance of gathering user feedback and leveraging it to enhance models and systems, ultimately leading to a better customer experience.
