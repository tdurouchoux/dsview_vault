A Data Product is a curated, domain-specific collection of data assets that are packaged and made available for consumption by other parts of an organization. Data Products are designed to be self-serve, allowing data consumers to easily discover, access, and integrate the data they need into their applications and analytics. Each Data Product is managed by a dedicated team of data product owners who are responsible for ensuring the quality, security, and compliance of the data, as well as making decisions about how the data can be used and shared.
