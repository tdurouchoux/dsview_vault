Hierarchical price elasticity models are used to estimate price sensitivity in retail settings. These models leverage the multilevel structure of retail data to produce more stable and economically sensible elasticity estimates, especially when individual products have limited price variation or sparse sales data. The hierarchical approach regularizes extreme elasticity values, making it particularly useful for large product catalogs.
