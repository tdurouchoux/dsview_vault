Hierarchical price elasticity models use Bayesian hierarchical methods to improve price elasticity estimates in retail settings, especially where data may be sparse at the individual product level. These models leverage the multilevel structure inherent in retail data, producing more stable and economically sensible elasticity estimates. The hierarchical approach regularizes extreme elasticity values often caused by data sparsity or outliers, making it particularly valuable for retailers with large product catalogs.
