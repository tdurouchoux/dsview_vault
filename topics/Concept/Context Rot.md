Context Rot is a phenomenon observed in language models where performance degrades as the amount of context information increases. This degradation occurs because the models struggle to handle and integrate large amounts of information, leading to unreliable outputs. Context engineering and thoughtful retrieval are essential to mitigate this issue.
