Reward function engineering involves defining and optimizing the reward functions that guide machine learning models. These functions are crucial for aligning model behavior with desired outcomes, especially in reinforcement learning. Effective reward functions can help models learn more efficiently and generalize better to real-world scenarios. However, designing good reward functions can be challenging due to the need to balance short-term and long-term rewards, handle sparsity, and ensure alignment with business metrics.
