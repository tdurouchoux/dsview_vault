The Convex Rosenbrock function is a test function used to evaluate the performance of optimization algorithms. It is characterized by a narrow, curved valley that makes it challenging for optimization algorithms to converge quickly. The function's condition number increases with the problem size, making it a useful benchmark for understanding the limits of first-order optimization algorithms like gradient descent and momentum.
