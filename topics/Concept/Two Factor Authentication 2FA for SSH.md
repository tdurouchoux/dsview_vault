Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for SSH adds an extra layer of security to the SSH login process. It requires users to provide two forms of identification: something they know (password) and something they have (a time-based one-time password generated by an authenticator app). This setup uses the Google Authenticator PAM module to verify the time-based one-time password (TOTP) after the user enters their password. This method enhances security by making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access, even if they have the password.
