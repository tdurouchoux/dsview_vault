Sentence embeddings are vector representations of sentences in a continuous vector space. They capture the semantic meaning of sentences, allowing machines to understand and process sentences more effectively. Sentence embeddings are widely used in various natural language processing tasks, such as sentence similarity, sentiment analysis, and more.
