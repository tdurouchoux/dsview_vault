Sentence embeddings are vector representations of sentences in a continuous vector space. They capture the semantic meaning of the sentences, allowing machine learning models to understand and process the sentences more effectively. Sentence embeddings are widely used in natural language processing tasks such as sentence classification, sentence similarity, and sentence retrieval.
