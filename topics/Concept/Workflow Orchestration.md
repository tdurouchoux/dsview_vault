Workflow orchestration is the process of coordinating the tasks of an ML workflow pipeline according to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAGs define the task execution order by considering relationships and dependencies. Workflow orchestration tools like Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, and AWS SageMaker Pipelines help manage and execute ML workflows efficiently.
