Workflow orchestration is the coordination of tasks within a machine learning workflow pipeline according to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). DAGs define the task execution order by considering relationships and dependencies between tasks. Workflow orchestration ensures that tasks are executed in the correct sequence, enabling efficient and automated execution of complex workflows. Examples of workflow orchestration tools include Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, and AWS SageMaker Pipelines.
