Effect size is a measure of the strength of a phenomenon or the size of the difference between groups in a study. It quantifies the practical significance of a result, complementing statistical significance. Common effect size measures include Cohen's d for mean differences and odds ratios for categorical data. Effect sizes help researchers understand the magnitude of an effect, which is crucial for assessing the practical importance of their findings. Reporting effect sizes alongside p-values provides a more comprehensive understanding of the results.
