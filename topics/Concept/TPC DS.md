TPC-DS is a decision support benchmark that evaluates the performance of hardware, operating systems, and data processing systems under a complex, multi-user decision support workload. It measures query response time in single-user mode, query throughput in multi-user mode, and data maintenance performance. The benchmark is designed to be relevant to a wide range of decision support systems and can be used to evaluate emerging technologies such as Big Data systems. The TPC-DS Price/Performance metric is expressed as Price/QphDS@Size for Version 2 and Price/kQphDS@Size for Version 3.
