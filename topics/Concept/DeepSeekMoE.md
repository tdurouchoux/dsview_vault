DeepSeekMoE is an architecture utilized in the DeepSeek-V3 model, building upon the efficient design of DeepSeek-V2. It incorporates a novel auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, which minimizes performance degradation by encouraging balanced load distribution. This architecture is integral to the model's ability to achieve high performance with reduced computational costs.
