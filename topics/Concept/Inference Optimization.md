Inference optimization refers to techniques used to enhance the efficiency and reduce the computational costs associated with running large language models (LLMs). Key methods include Flash Attention, which optimizes the attention mechanism to reduce its complexity, and the use of key-value caches to improve performance. Speculative decoding is another technique where a smaller model generates drafts that are reviewed by a larger model to speed up text generation. These optimizations are crucial for maximizing throughput and reducing inference costs, making LLMs more practical for deployment in various applications.
