Python comparison refers to the process of comparing values using comparison operators. These operators include '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', and '>='. Comparison operations return boolean values (True or False) and are used in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program. Understanding comparison is crucial for making decisions in Python programs.
