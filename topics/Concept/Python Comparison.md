Python comparison is the process of comparing two or more values or objects to determine their relationship. Python supports several comparison operators, including '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', and '>='. Comparison operations return a boolean value of 'True' or 'False', and are used extensively in conditional statements and loops to control the flow of a program.
