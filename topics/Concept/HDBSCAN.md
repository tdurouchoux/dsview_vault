HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that extends DBSCAN by converting it into a hierarchical clustering algorithm. HDBSCAN is particularly useful for clustering data with varying densities and can handle noise in the data. It is used in BERTopic for clustering documents based on their embeddings.
