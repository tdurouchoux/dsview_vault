Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) is a clustering algorithm that extends DBSCAN by converting it into a hierarchical clustering algorithm. It is particularly useful for finding clusters of varying densities and dealing with noise in the data. In Latent Scope, HDBSCAN is used to cluster the points resulting from UMAP projections, labeling each point with a cluster label.
