Agentic coding refers to the use of AI agents to perform coding tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These agents can understand and execute coding tasks, interact with development tools, and collaborate with developers to enhance productivity. Agentic coding tools like Claude Code can handle complex codebases, plan code changes, and perform full-stack updates, making them valuable for software development.
