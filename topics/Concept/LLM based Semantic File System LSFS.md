A file system that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to enable semantic file management. It allows users to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating tasks such as semantic file retrieval, file update summarization, and semantic file rollback. LSFS enhances traditional file systems by leveraging semantic information for more intuitive and efficient file operations.
