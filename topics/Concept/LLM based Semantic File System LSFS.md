A file system that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to enable semantic file management. It allows users to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating tasks such as semantic file retrieval, file update summarization, and semantic file rollback. LSFS constructs semantic indexes for files, uses vector databases for storage, and implements syscalls and APIs for various file operations.
