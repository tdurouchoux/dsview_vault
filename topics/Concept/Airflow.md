Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It is designed to handle complex computational workflows and data processing tasks, making it a crucial tool for data engineers and data scientists. Airflow uses DAGs to define workflows, allowing users to specify the order in which tasks should be executed and the dependencies between them.
