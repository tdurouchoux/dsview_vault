Structural Patterns in data pipelines refer to how tasks and transformations are organized within the pipeline. These patterns help in managing the complexity of data flows and ensuring that the pipeline is maintainable and scalable. Examples include multi-hop pipelines, which separate data into different levels of cleanliness, conditional/dynamic pipelines, which handle complex flows based on input or run time, and disconnected data pipelines, which depend on the sinks of other pipelines. Structural patterns help in improving the efficiency and reliability of data pipelines.
