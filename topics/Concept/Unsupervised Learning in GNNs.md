Unsupervised learning in GNNs involves training the model without labeled data. This allows for the computation of continuous representations (or embeddings) of the discrete graph structure of nodes and their features. These embeddings can then be utilized in other machine learning systems, incorporating the discrete, relational information encoded by a graph.
