GeoAI refers to the application of artificial intelligence techniques to geospatial data and problems. It involves using machine learning, deep learning, and other AI methods to analyze and interpret geographic information, such as satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and vector data. GeoAI aims to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and insights gained from geospatial data, enabling better decision-making in fields like urban planning, environmental monitoring, disaster response, and climate research.
