Abstractive summarization is a technique in natural language processing where the goal is to generate a concise summary of a given text by understanding and condensing its content. Unlike extractive summarization, which selects and combines sentences or phrases from the original text, abstractive summarization generates new sentences that capture the essence of the source material. This approach often involves advanced language models that can understand context, semantics, and syntactic structures to produce coherent and fluent summaries.
