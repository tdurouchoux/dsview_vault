FlexAttention is a flexible and efficient attention mechanism designed to optimize the performance of transformer models, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). It aims to address challenges related to computational efficiency and scalability by dynamically adjusting attention mechanisms based on the specific requirements of the task at hand.
