Shapley values are a method from cooperative game theory used to fairly distribute gains or costs among participants based on their contributions. In the context of machine learning, Shapley values are used to explain the output of a model by showing how much each feature contributes to the prediction. They provide a way to understand the importance of each feature in the model's decision-making process, making them a valuable tool for model interpretability and explainability.
