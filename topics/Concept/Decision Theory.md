Decision theory is a framework for making decisions under uncertainty. It involves evaluating the outcomes of different actions and choosing the action that maximizes expected utility or minimizes expected loss. Decision theory can be applied in both frequentist and Bayesian contexts, but Bayesian methods often make decision theory more straightforward by incorporating prior beliefs and updating them with data to inform decisions.
