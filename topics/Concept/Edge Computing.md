Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data locally on edge devices, such as mobile phones or the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, rather than in the cloud. This approach ensures near-instant latency, total data privacy, and efficient performance within the compute and battery limits of edge devices. Edge computing is crucial for applications that require local-first deployment and can handle common commands on-device, only querying larger models for more complex tasks.
