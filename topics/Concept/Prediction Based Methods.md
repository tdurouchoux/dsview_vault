Prediction-Based Methods are anomaly detection techniques that use predictive models to identify anomalies. These methods involve training a model on normal data to learn the expected behavior of the system. The model is then used to predict future data points, and any significant deviations from the predicted values are flagged as anomalies. Common prediction-based methods include time-series forecasting models, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. These methods are widely used in applications such as financial forecasting, healthcare monitoring, and industrial process control, where predicting future behavior is crucial for detecting anomalies.
