Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a method of quality control which employs statistical methods to monitor and control a process to ensure that it operates at its full potential. SPC involves collecting and analyzing data from a process to detect and correct variations that may lead to defects or inefficiencies. It is widely used in manufacturing to maintain quality and consistency in production processes. SPC helps in identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in process data, enabling proactive adjustments to maintain quality standards.
