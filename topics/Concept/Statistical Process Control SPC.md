Statistical Process Control (SPC) is a method used in manufacturing to monitor and control the quality of processes. It involves collecting and analyzing data from processes to ensure they operate within specified limits, thereby reducing variability and improving product quality. SPC uses statistical techniques to identify and correct process variations, ensuring consistent and reliable production outcomes.
