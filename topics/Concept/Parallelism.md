Parallelism in the context of Mixture of Experts (MoE) models refers to the distribution of computational tasks across multiple processing units to enhance training and inference efficiency. Different parallelism strategies, such as data parallelism, model parallelism, and expert parallelism, are used to optimize the performance of MoE models on distributed systems.
