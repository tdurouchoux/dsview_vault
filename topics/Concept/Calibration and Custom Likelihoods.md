Calibration and custom likelihoods enhance probabilistic forecasting models by incorporating domain knowledge or experimental data. This process involves adjusting model parameters based on external information to improve forecasts, especially in scenarios where historical data is limited or does not fully represent future conditions. This technique is valuable for making forecasts more reliable and actionable.
