Calibration and custom likelihoods enhance probabilistic forecasting models by incorporating domain knowledge or experimental data. This approach involves using additional likelihood terms that reflect external knowledge, such as experimental lift test results, known physical constraints, or other domain expertise. This calibration technique is especially valuable when historical data doesn't fully represent all possible future scenarios or when unobserved confounders are suspected.
