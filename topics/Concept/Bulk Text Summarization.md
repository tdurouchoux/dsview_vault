Bulk text summarization is the process of automatically condensing large volumes of text into shorter summaries while retaining the key information. This technique is particularly useful for efficiently processing and analyzing vast amounts of textual data, such as comments, articles, or reports. By summarizing text in bulk, users can quickly grasp the main points and insights from the data, saving time and effort.
