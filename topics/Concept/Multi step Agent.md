A multi-step agent is a type of agent that operates in a loop, executing a new action at each step based on the LLM's decisions. This loop continues until the observations indicate that the task has been satisfactorily completed. Multi-step agents are useful for tasks that require a series of actions and decisions to achieve a goal.
