Autointerpretability is a method where an AI system itself is used to analyze and interpret the features and concepts within another AI model. This approach leverages the capabilities of AI to scale the process of identifying and understanding the meanings of features, making it more efficient and effective. By using AI to analyze AI, researchers can gain deeper insights into the model's internal workings and improve interpretability.
