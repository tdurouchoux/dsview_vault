E-CDCTR is a transfer learning framework that uses organic item data to improve click-through rate (CTR) predictions in advertising. It involves three components: the tiny pretraining model (TPM), complete pretraining model (CPM), and advertising CTR model (A-CTR). E-CDCTR aims to tackle the challenge of sparse ad data by leveraging rich organic data to enhance the performance of CTR prediction models.
