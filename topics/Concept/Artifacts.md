Artifacts is a new feature introduced in Claude.ai that allows users to generate and interact with content such as code snippets, text documents, or website designs in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This feature creates a dynamic workspace where users can see, edit, and build upon AI-generated content in real-time, seamlessly integrating it into their projects and workflows. It marks a shift from conversational AI to a collaborative work environment, supporting team collaboration and centralized knowledge management.
