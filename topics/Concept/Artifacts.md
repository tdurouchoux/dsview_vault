Artifacts is a feature introduced in Claude.ai that allows users to generate and interact with content such as code snippets, text documents, and website designs in a dedicated window alongside their conversation with the AI. This feature creates a dynamic workspace where users can see, edit, and build upon AI-generated content in real-time. Artifacts represent a shift from conversational AI to a collaborative work environment, enabling seamless integration of AI-generated content into projects and workflows. This feature is particularly useful for tasks that require iterative development and collaboration, such as coding, content creation, and design.
