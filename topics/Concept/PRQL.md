PRQL, or Pipelined Relational Query Language, is a modern query language designed to be more intuitive and expressive than SQL. It uses a pipeline-based syntax that allows for a more natural and readable way to express database queries. PRQL aims to simplify the process of data manipulation and transformation by leveraging a more modern and user-friendly syntax.
