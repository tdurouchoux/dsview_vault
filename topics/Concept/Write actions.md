Write actions are tools that allow an agent to not only perceive its environment but also make changes to it. These actions can include modifying data, sending emails, initiating bank transfers, and other operations that alter the state of the environment. Write actions enable agents to automate complex workflows but also require careful consideration of security and trust.
