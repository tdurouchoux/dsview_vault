Write actions refer to the ability of an agent to not only perceive and interact with its environment but also to make changes to it. This can include actions like modifying data in a database, sending emails, or initiating transactions. Write actions enable agents to automate complex workflows and perform tasks that require real-world interactions, but they also come with risks and require careful management to ensure security and reliability.
