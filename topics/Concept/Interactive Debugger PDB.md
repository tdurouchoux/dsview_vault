Python comes with a built-in debugger called PDB (Python Debugger). It allows you to pause the execution of your Python code, inspect variables, and step through your code line by line to find and fix issues. While print statements and logging are helpful for basic debugging, PDB takes debugging to the next level by allowing you to intervene and analyze your code in real-time.
