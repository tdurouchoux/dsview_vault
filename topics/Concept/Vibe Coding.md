A style of programming where developers rely heavily on LLMs to generate and iterate on code, often without deeply understanding the underlying codebase. This approach emphasizes rapid prototyping and experimentation, leveraging the capabilities of advanced coding agents to build functional software quickly. It is characterized by a focus on achieving results through prompting rather than traditional coding practices.
