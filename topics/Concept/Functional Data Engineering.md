Functional Data Engineering is an approach that emphasizes confident reproducibility with minimal side effects, using idempotency to restart functions to recover and reinstate a particular state or roll back to a specific version. It focuses on creating a stateless stack that can be recreated from scratch with its configuration, setting aside intermediate data assets produced along the way.
