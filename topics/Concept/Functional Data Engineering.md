Functional Data Engineering is an approach that emphasizes confident reproducibility with minimal side effects, using idempotency to restart functions to recover and reinstate a particular state or roll back to a specific version. This method focuses on creating a data engineering lifecycle that is reliable and predictable, leveraging functional programming principles to manage data transformations and processes.
