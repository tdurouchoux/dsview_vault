Human-centered design principles focus on creating tools and systems that facilitate intuitive interactions, build user trust, and streamline workflows. In the context of AI-powered data analysis, these principles involve designing user interfaces that reduce the effort required for intent specification, enhance the ability to understand and verify system outputs, and streamline the analysis workflow to reduce iteration overhead across multiple steps and tools. These principles aim to make data analysis tools more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for non-expert users.
