TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight, open-source deep learning framework developed by Google for deploying machine learning models on mobile and embedded devices. It is designed to enable low-latency inference of on-device machine learning models, making it suitable for applications that require real-time performance and minimal resource usage. TensorFlow Lite supports a subset of TensorFlow operations and provides tools to convert trained TensorFlow models into a format optimized for mobile and embedded platforms.
