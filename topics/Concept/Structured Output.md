Structured Outputs refer to the format in which a language model presents its responses in a organized and predictable manner. This can include specific data formats like JSON, tables, or predefined templates. Structured outputs are particularly useful for tasks that require precise and consistent data representation, making it easier for other systems or users to parse and utilize the information. This feature is supported by models like gpt-oss-safeguard-120b and gpt-oss-safeguard-20b and can be achieved using parameters like struct and struct_descr to specify the desired format and constraints for the model's responses.
