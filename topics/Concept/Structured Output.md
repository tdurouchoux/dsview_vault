Structured output refers to the generation of data in a predefined format or schema, ensuring that the output adheres to a specific structure. This is particularly useful in data analysis and integration workflows, as it allows for easy manipulation and querying of the generated data. In the context of LLMs, structured output can be achieved using parameters like struct and struct_descr to specify the desired format and constraints for the model's responses.
