Distance-Based Methods are a category of anomaly detection techniques that rely on measuring the distance between data points to identify anomalies. These methods assume that anomalies are points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. Common distance measures include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and cosine similarity. By calculating the distance of each data point from its neighbors, these methods can identify points that are far from the norm, indicating potential anomalies. Distance-based methods are widely used in various applications, including fraud detection, network intrusion detection, and fault detection in industrial systems.
