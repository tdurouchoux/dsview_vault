Modular design in software development involves breaking down a system into smaller, independent modules that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. This approach enhances flexibility, scalability, and ease of collaboration. In the context of the Transformers library, modular design allows for easier model contributions, better maintenance, and faster integration of new models.
