Memory Architectures in AI refer to the systems used to store and retrieve information for AI Agents. These architectures include episodic memory for task-specific history, semantic memory for long-term facts or structured data, and vector-based memory for similarity-based retrieval. Memory Architectures are crucial for personalization, adaptive decision-making, and maintaining context across tasks. They enable AI Agents to learn from past interactions and improve their performance over time.
