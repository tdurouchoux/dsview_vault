Graph embeddings are techniques used to represent graph data in a continuous vector space, capturing the relationships and structure of the graph. These embeddings allow for the application of machine learning algorithms to graph data by converting nodes and edges into numerical representations that can be processed by neural networks. Graph embedding algorithms aim to preserve the structural and topological properties of the graph in the vector representations, enabling various downstream machine learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Node representation learning refers to the process of mapping nodes in a graph to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving the structural and attribute information of the nodes. Techniques like DeepWalk, TransE, and node2vec are commonly used for this purpose.
