Data mixture refers to the combination of different datasets used to train a model. In the context of SmolVLM, the data mixture has been updated to include datasets like The Cauldron, Docmatix, and MathWriting, with a stronger emphasis on document understanding and image captioning. This helps the model perform better on a variety of tasks.
