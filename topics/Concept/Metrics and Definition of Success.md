Defining metrics and the definition of success involves establishing clear, measurable criteria for evaluating the outcome of a project. This includes setting baselines, determining the methods for experimentation (e.g., A/B testing), and outlining the expected impact. Clear metrics serve as a 'North Star,' guiding the project towards its goals and ensuring that stakeholders are aligned on what constitutes a successful outcome.
