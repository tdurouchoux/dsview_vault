The AI first draft pattern is a practical approach to using AI-assisted coding tools effectively. It involves allowing the AI to generate a basic implementation of a feature or module, which is then manually reviewed and refined by the developer. This pattern emphasizes the importance of modularity, comprehensive error handling, thorough testing, and clear documentation to ensure the quality and maintainability of the code. By combining the speed and efficiency of AI with the expertise and judgment of human developers, this pattern aims to leverage the strengths of both to produce high-quality software.
