Message passing is a technique used in Graph Neural Networks to exchange information between nodes or edges in a graph. It involves three main steps: gathering information from neighboring nodes or edges, aggregating the gathered information, and updating the node or edge embeddings based on the aggregated information. Message passing allows nodes to incorporate information from across the entire graph and is a key component in building sophisticated GNN models.
