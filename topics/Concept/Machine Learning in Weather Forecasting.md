Machine learning in weather forecasting involves the use of algorithms and models to analyze and predict weather patterns. By leveraging large datasets and advanced computational techniques, machine learning can improve the accuracy and efficiency of weather predictions. This approach is increasingly being used to enhance traditional numerical weather prediction systems and develop new, data-driven forecasting models.
