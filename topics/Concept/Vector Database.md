A vector database is a type of database designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of data. These databases are optimized for similarity search and retrieval, making them suitable for applications like information retrieval, recommendation systems, and generative AI. In Jupyter AI, a vector database is used to store embeddings of local files, allowing the AI to learn from and ask questions about these files. Vector databases, also known as vectorstores, are specialized databases designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of data points in a high-dimensional space. These databases are particularly useful in machine learning and AI applications, where they enable efficient similarity search and retrieval of data based on vector representations. Vector databases are commonly used in tasks such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and generative AI applications.
