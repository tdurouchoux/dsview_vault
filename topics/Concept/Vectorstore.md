A vectorstore is a database system designed to store and manage high-dimensional vectors, typically used in machine learning and information retrieval tasks. Vectorstores are optimized for efficient similarity search, allowing quick retrieval of the most similar vectors to a given query vector. This is particularly useful in applications like recommendation systems, image search, and natural language processing, where the goal is to find items or information that are semantically similar to a given input.
