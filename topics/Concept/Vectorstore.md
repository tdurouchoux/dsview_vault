A vectorstore is a database specifically designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of data such as text, images, or other types of information. Vectorstores are optimized for fast and efficient similarity search, allowing for the retrieval of the most relevant vectors based on a query vector. This is particularly useful in machine learning and AI applications, where similarity search is a common operation. Examples of vectorstores mentioned in the text include PGVector and Faiss.
