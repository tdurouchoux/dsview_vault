Cache pressure refers to the demand on the CPU cache caused by the frequency and size of data accesses. High cache pressure occurs when the data accessed by a program exceeds the capacity of the cache, leading to more cache misses and slower performance. Managing cache pressure is important for optimizing the performance of CPU-bound applications, especially those dealing with large datasets.
