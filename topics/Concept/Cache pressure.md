Cache pressure refers to the demand for space in the CPU cache, which can occur when the amount of data being processed exceeds the available cache size. High cache pressure can lead to increased cache misses, as the CPU is forced to frequently evict and reload data from the main memory. This can result in significant performance degradation, especially in data-intensive applications. Managing cache pressure involves optimizing data access patterns and ensuring that the most frequently accessed data fits within the available cache.
