The Bradley-Terry model is a statistical method used to analyze pairwise comparisons and rank items based on their performance. In the context of AI evaluation, it is used to compute model scores and rankings by translating pairwise win rates into a standardized scale, such as the Elo scale, to compare the performance of different models.
