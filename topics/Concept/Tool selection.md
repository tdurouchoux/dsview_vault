Tool selection is the process of choosing the right set of tools for an AI agent to use. The selection depends on the environment, the task, and the AI model's capabilities. Effective tool selection requires experimentation and analysis to balance the number of tools with the agent's ability to use them efficiently. Tools can be combined or created from simpler ones to enhance the agent's capabilities.
