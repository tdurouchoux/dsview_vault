The self-critique mechanism is a method used in AI to enable agents to evaluate and improve their own performance. This involves the agent assessing its actions, identifying errors or suboptimal decisions, and making adjustments to enhance future performance. It is a key component in frameworks like AgentQ, which aims to create more robust and reliable AI agents. Reflection and error correction are mechanisms that help agents evaluate and improve their performance. Reflection involves assessing the generated plans and outcomes to identify errors and areas for improvement. Error correction involves adjusting the plans and actions based on the insights gained from reflection to maximize the chance of success.
