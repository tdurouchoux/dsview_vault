Eigenvalue decomposition is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. This decomposition is useful in various fields, including optimization and machine learning, as it simplifies the analysis of matrix properties and behaviors. In the context of gradient descent, eigenvalue decomposition helps in understanding the convergence rates of different components of the error.
