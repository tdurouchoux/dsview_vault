Eigenvalue decomposition is a matrix decomposition technique that breaks down a matrix into a set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In the context of optimization, it helps in understanding the convergence behavior of algorithms by analyzing the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix or other relevant matrices. The eigenvalues indicate the directions of fastest and slowest convergence, and their decomposition helps in visualizing and mitigating pathological curvature.
