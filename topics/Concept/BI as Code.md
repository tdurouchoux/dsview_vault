BI-as-Code is a methodology that involves defining and managing business intelligence assets through code. This approach includes using SQL for data models, YAML for configuration, and leveraging version control systems like Git. It allows for the deployment and management of analytics stacks from the command line, ensuring that analytics assets are version-controlled, shareable, and easily rehydrated. This method leverages declarative languages to describe business metrics, relationships between data dimensions, and visualizations. By defining BI artifacts in code, BI-as-Code enables version control, automation, and integration with AI models, making the BI process more efficient and scalable. This approach is foundational for GenBI, as it provides the structured context that AI models need to understand and generate BI artifacts.
