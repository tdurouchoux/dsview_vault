BI-as-Code is a methodology that treats business intelligence artifacts, such as dashboards and metrics, as code. This approach involves defining dashboards and metrics in declarative languages like YAML or SQL, making them versionable, automatable, and machine-readable. BI-as-Code enables better collaboration, version control, and integration with CI/CD pipelines, making the BI development process more efficient and scalable. It also provides a semantic foundation that AI models can understand, facilitating the generation and modification of BI artifacts.
