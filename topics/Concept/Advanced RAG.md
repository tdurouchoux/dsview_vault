Advanced RAG is an evolution of the Naive RAG methodology, aimed at addressing its limitations. It introduces targeted improvements in various aspects of the RAG process, including data indexing, embedding fine-tuning, and the retrieval process. Advanced RAG optimizes data indexing by enhancing data granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, alignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. It also fine-tunes embedding models to improve the relevance of retrieved content and uses post-retrieval processes such as re-ranking and prompt compression to enhance the quality of the retrieved information. These improvements aim to address issues such as low precision and recall, outdated information, and response generation quality, making Advanced RAG more effective and reliable in practical applications.
