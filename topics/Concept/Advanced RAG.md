Advanced RAG builds upon the Naive RAG framework by introducing targeted improvements to address its limitations. This paradigm focuses on optimizing data indexing, enhancing retrieval processes, and improving the quality of generated responses. Advanced RAG employs techniques such as pre-retrieval and post-retrieval methods to refine the retrieval process. It also introduces various optimization strategies for data indexing, including increasing data granularity, optimizing index structures, adding metadata, alignment optimization, and mixed retrieval. These enhancements aim to improve the accuracy, relevance, and robustness of the RAG system, making it more effective for a wide range of applications.
