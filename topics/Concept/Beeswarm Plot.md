A beeswarm plot is a type of visualization used to display the distribution of data points in a way that avoids overlap, providing a clear view of the data's structure. In the context of machine learning and explainable AI, beeswarm plots are used to visualize the distribution of Shapley values for each feature. Each point represents a Shapley value, and the plot allows for the identification of patterns and relationships between features and their contributions to the model's predictions. The beeswarm plot is particularly useful for understanding the global importance of features and how they influence the model's predictions across the entire dataset.
