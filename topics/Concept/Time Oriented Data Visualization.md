Time-Oriented Data Visualization refers to techniques and methods used to visually represent data that has a temporal dimension. This type of visualization helps in understanding patterns, trends, and changes over time. It is crucial for analyzing time-series data, scheduling, and any domain where time is a significant factor. Various techniques include static and dynamic mappings, 2D and 3D representations, and different arrangements like linear and cyclic.
