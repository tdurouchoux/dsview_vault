A hybrid reasoning model combines the capabilities of quick responses and deep reflection into a single model. Unlike traditional models that separate these functions, hybrid reasoning models integrate both to provide a seamless user experience. This approach allows the model to switch between standard and extended thinking modes, optimizing for speed and quality of answers based on the task at hand.
