A graph is a data structure that represents the relationships (edges) between entities (nodes). Graphs can be directed or undirected, and can include various types of attributes such as node features, edge features, and global graph features. They are used to model a wide range of data, including social networks, molecular structures, citation networks, and more. They are a flexible and powerful representation for data with complex connectivity patterns. Network graphs are useful for visualizing complex relationships and patterns in data. The source text discusses the importance of trying different layouts to make network graphs more interpretable.
