Hooks in Claude Code are deterministic rules that enforce specific actions or validations at certain points in the development process. They can be used to block or hint at actions, ensuring that the agent follows best practices and maintains code quality. Hooks are particularly useful in complex enterprise repositories to enforce state validation at commit time, preventing errors and ensuring consistency.
