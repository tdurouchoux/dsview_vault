GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Goodfellow et al. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which are trained together. The generator creates data, while the discriminator evaluates it, leading to an adversarial process where the generator improves over time. GANs are widely used for generating realistic images, art, and other media.
