Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks: the generator, which creates data, and the discriminator, which evaluates the created data. The generator aims to produce data that resembles real data, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated data. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that the discriminator can no longer reliably distinguish from real data. GANs have been used for various applications, including image generation, style transfer, and even creating realistic human faces. Variants of GANs include Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs), Conditional GANs (CGANs), and Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), each with specific improvements and applications.
