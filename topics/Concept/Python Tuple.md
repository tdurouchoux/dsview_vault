A Python tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items. Tuples are defined by enclosing items in parentheses and separating them with commas. They support operations like indexing, slicing, and concatenation, and can be used as keys in dictionaries. Tuples are often used to store related pieces of information together, such as the coordinates of a point or the fields of a database record.
