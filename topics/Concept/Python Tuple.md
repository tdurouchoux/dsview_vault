A Python tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of items. Tuples are defined by enclosing items in parentheses and are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Tuples are useful for grouping related data and ensuring that the data remains constant. They provide various methods for accessing and manipulating the data they contain.
