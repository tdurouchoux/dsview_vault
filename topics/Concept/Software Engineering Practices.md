Software Engineering Practices refer to the methodologies, techniques, and processes used by software engineers to develop, maintain, and improve software systems. These practices are crucial for ensuring the sustainability and health of a codebase, especially in large-scale projects like those at Google. They include coding standards, testing strategies, code reviews, documentation practices, and more. The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase that can evolve with the needs of the organization and its users.
