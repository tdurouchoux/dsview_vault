Time series prediction involves using statistical or machine learning models to forecast future values based on historical data. Time series data is unique because it has a temporal component, meaning the order of observations matters. Techniques for time series prediction range from simple visualization tools to advanced machine learning models like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. These models leverage past values, trends, seasonality, and other features to make accurate predictions.
