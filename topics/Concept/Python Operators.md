Python operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are used to perform arithmetic, comparison, logical, and other types of operations. Examples of Python operators include '+', '-', '*', '/', '=', '==', '>', '<', 'and', 'or', and 'not'. Operators are fundamental to writing expressions and controlling the flow of a program in Python.
