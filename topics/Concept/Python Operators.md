Python operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They include arithmetic operators like '+', '-', '*', and '/', comparison operators like '==', '!=', '<', and '>', logical operators like 'and', 'or', and 'not', and assignment operators like '=' and '+='. Operators are used to perform operations and make decisions in Python code.
