MCP Servers are servers built using the Model Context Protocol. They expose data and functionality to LLM applications in a secure, standardized way. MCP servers can provide tools for executing code, resources for loading information into the LLM's context, and prompts for defining interaction patterns. FastMCP is a framework that simplifies the creation and management of MCP servers.
