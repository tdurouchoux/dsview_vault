Flow Engineering refers to the design and optimization of workflows that involve multiple steps or stages, often using large language models (LLMs). It focuses on breaking down complex tasks into simpler, manageable steps, and optimizing the sequence and interaction of these steps to improve overall performance and reliability. Flow engineering can involve both deterministic and non-deterministic workflows.
