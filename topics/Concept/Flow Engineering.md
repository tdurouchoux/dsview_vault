Flow engineering involves designing and optimizing the workflows and processes that interact with large language models (LLMs). This can include breaking down complex tasks into simpler, more manageable steps, and using structured inputs and outputs to improve the reliability and efficiency of the model's performance. Effective flow engineering can help ensure that the model's outputs are consistent and reliable, and can be easily integrated into downstream systems.
