A method of modeling the reasoning process of an LLM as a graph, where thoughts are vertices and dependencies between thoughts are edges. This approach allows for novel transformations of thoughts, such as aggregation, and enables more complex and flexible reasoning processes compared to linear or tree-based methods.
