Generative Offensive Agent Testing (GOAT) is an advanced red-teaming method designed to simulate multi-turn interactions of medium-skilled adversarial actors. This approach helps in identifying vulnerabilities and potential risks in AI models more efficiently and effectively. GOAT combines automation with expert human red teaming, allowing for broader testing coverage and faster identification of vulnerabilities. By focusing automation on known risk areas, GOAT enables human experts to concentrate on more novel adversarial areas, thereby improving the overall security and robustness of AI models.
