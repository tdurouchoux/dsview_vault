Knowledge augmentation involves enhancing an agent's capabilities by providing it with access to additional knowledge sources. This can include tools that retrieve information from databases, APIs, or other data sources, enabling the agent to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Knowledge augmentation helps reduce hallucinations and keeps the agent's responses up-to-date with the latest information.
