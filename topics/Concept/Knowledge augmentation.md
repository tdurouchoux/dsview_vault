Knowledge augmentation involves using tools that help an agent access and incorporate additional knowledge to improve its responses. This can include tools like text retrievers, image retrievers, SQL executors, and APIs that provide access to public or private information. These tools help prevent models from going stale and reduce hallucinations by providing up-to-date and relevant context.
