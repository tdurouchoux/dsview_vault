Functional Generative Network (FGN) is an AI modeling approach used in WeatherNext 2. It injects 'noise' directly into the model architecture to generate forecasts that remain physically realistic and interconnected. This approach is particularly useful for predicting both marginals (individual weather elements) and joints (complex, interconnected systems), enhancing the accuracy and usefulness of weather forecasts.
