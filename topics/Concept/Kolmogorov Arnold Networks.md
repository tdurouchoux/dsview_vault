Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a type of neural network architecture based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) that have activation functions on nodes, KANs have activation functions on edges. This structural difference allows KANs to achieve better model accuracy and interpretability in various tasks. KANs are particularly useful in scenarios where high accuracy and interpretability are crucial, such as scientific computing and certain machine learning applications. The architecture of KANs is designed to leverage the strong mathematical foundations of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, providing a robust alternative to traditional neural network models.
