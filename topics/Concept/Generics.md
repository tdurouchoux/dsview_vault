Generics in Python allow developers to write flexible and reusable code by defining classes, functions, or data structures that can operate on any data type. Introduced in Python 3.5 with TypeVar syntax and enhanced in Python 3.12 with native syntax, generics enable type safety and code clarity. They support type constraints, variadic generics, and type aliases, making them a powerful tool for developers.
