Generics in Python allow you to write flexible and reusable code by defining classes, functions, or methods that can operate on any data type. They are particularly useful for creating data structures that can work with different types of data, such as lists, dictionaries, or custom classes. Generics help ensure type safety and improve code readability by making the expected types explicit.
