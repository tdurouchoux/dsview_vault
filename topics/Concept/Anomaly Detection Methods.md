Anomaly Detection Methods encompass a variety of techniques and algorithms designed to identify anomalies in data. These methods can be categorized into several types, including statistical methods, machine learning models, and deep learning approaches. Statistical methods often involve setting thresholds or using probability distributions to detect outliers. Machine learning models, such as clustering, classification, and regression algorithms, can be trained to recognize patterns and identify deviations. Deep learning approaches, including neural networks, leverage large datasets to learn complex patterns and detect anomalies. These methods are applied in various domains to ensure data quality, security, and system reliability.
