A term used to describe the practice of conducting research and experiments using proprietary, closed-source APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) of large language models. API Science involves studying the behavior and capabilities of these models through their APIs, often without access to the underlying data or algorithms. This approach has been controversial due to concerns about reproducibility and the reliance on proprietary technology.
