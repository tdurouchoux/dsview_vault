Value-based methods in reinforcement learning involve estimating the value of actions or states to guide decision-making. These methods focus on learning a value function that estimates the expected return of taking a particular action in a given state or being in a particular state. Techniques like Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) fall under this category.
