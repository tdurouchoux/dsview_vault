Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift from isolated AI Agents to orchestrated, multi-agent ecosystems capable of decomposing and executing complex goals. These systems typically consist of orchestrated or communicating agents that interact via tools, APIs, and shared environments. Agentic AI systems are designed to support more complex, distributed, and adaptive behaviors compared to traditional AI Agents. They involve multiple specialized agents collaborating to achieve complex, high-level objectives utilizing collaborative reasoning and multi-step planning. Key characteristics include goal decomposition, inter-agent communication, and persistent memory, enabling these systems to exhibit flexible, adaptive, cooperative, and collaborative intelligence. A multi-agent AI system is a framework composed of multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to achieve complex tasks. Each agent has a unique role and logic, working together to solve problems, generate hypotheses, and refine outputs. This system is designed to mimic human-like reasoning and collaboration, leveraging automated feedback and iterative processes to improve performance and accuracy. Multi-Agent Architecture in the context of AI refers to a system where multiple AI agents or models work together to perform complex tasks. Each agent is specialized in a specific function or task, and they collaborate to achieve a common goal. This architecture often involves a controller agent that manages the overall flow of information and delegates tasks to specialized agents (delegates). The controller agent coordinates the interactions between the different agents, ensuring that the system can handle a wide range of user queries and tasks efficiently. This approach can improve the accuracy, flexibility, and scalability of AI systems, making them more adaptable to various user needs and scenarios. Multi-Agent Systems are AI systems composed of multiple specialized agents that work together to perform complex tasks. These systems leverage the strengths of individual agents to achieve goals that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to accomplish alone. Multi-Agent Systems are particularly useful for applications that require collaboration, coordination, and distributed problem-solving, such as research assistance and task management.
