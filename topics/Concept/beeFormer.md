beeFormer is a method that trains language-only Transformers on user-item interaction data enriched with textual information. It combines a sentence Transformer encoder for item embeddings with an ELSA-based decoder to capture patterns from user-item interactions. The goal is to bridge the gap between semantic similarity and interaction-based similarity, improving the accuracy of recommendations.
