Visual encoding in data visualization refers to the use of visual elements to represent data values. These elements include color, size, shape, and position, which help convey quantitative information effectively. By mapping data to these visual attributes, charts and graphs enable viewers to quickly grasp patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Different types of visual encodings, such as bar lengths in bar charts or point positions in scatter plots, serve to highlight various aspects of the dataset, making complex information more accessible and interpretable.
