Few-shot Prompting is a technique in prompt engineering where the model is provided with a few examples (shots) within the prompt to guide its responses. This helps the model understand the desired task or behavior with minimal examples, improving its performance on specific tasks. This method is efficient for learning but can lead to higher token costs at test time due to the inclusion of demonstration content. It is particularly useful for tasks where the patterns are simple and the model's domain knowledge is sufficient.
