Few-shot prompting is a technique in natural language processing where a model is provided with a few examples (shots) of the task or question type before being asked to generate a response. This approach helps the model understand the context and requirements of the task better, leading to more accurate and relevant responses, even for tasks it was not explicitly trained on. This method is efficient for learning but increases token costs at test time due to the inclusion of more content in the prompt.
