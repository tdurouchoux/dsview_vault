A go-to-market (GTM) strategy is a plan that outlines how a company will reach its target market and deliver its product or service. It includes the tactics and channels used to attract, engage, and convert potential customers. GTM strategies often involve marketing, sales, and distribution plans that align with the company's business objectives and target audience.
