Generalization and memorization are two different approaches to learning and problem-solving in artificial intelligence. Memorization involves storing and retrieving specific instances or patterns, while generalization involves learning underlying principles that can be applied to new, unseen situations. The ARC benchmark is designed to test a machine's ability to generalize from core knowledge rather than rely on memorization, making it a significant tool in the assessment of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
