FutureBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate AI agents on their ability to predict future events. It draws from real-world prediction markets and emerging news to create prediction tasks grounded in actual future outcomes. The benchmark operates on three levels: framework comparison, tool performance, and model capabilities, allowing for a systematic evaluation of AI agents' prediction capabilities.
