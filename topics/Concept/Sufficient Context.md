Sufficient Context is a notion developed to determine whether the context provided to a large language model (LLM) contains enough information to answer a given query. This concept is crucial for understanding and improving the performance of RAG systems. An instance is considered to have sufficient context if the context contains all the necessary information to provide a definitive answer to the query. This designation is a function of an input pair consisting of one question and the associated context and does not require a ground truth answer. The sufficient context designation helps in classifying instances based on whether the context provides enough information to construct an answer to the query, thereby aiding in the analysis of model responses and the development of strategies to reduce hallucinations in RAG systems.
