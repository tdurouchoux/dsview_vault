The Controller-Delegate Pattern is an architectural approach used in multi-agent systems to manage the interaction between different AI agents. In this pattern, a central controller agent is responsible for managing the overall flow of the conversation and delegating specific tasks to specialized delegate agents. The controller agent receives the user's input, determines the appropriate task or function to be performed, and then delegates the task to the relevant delegate agent. The delegate agent performs the task and returns the results to the controller, which then incorporates the results into the conversation. This pattern allows for a more modular and flexible system, where different agents can be specialized in specific tasks, improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of the system. Agent handoffs refer to the process of transferring control or conversation from one agent to another within a multi-agent system. This mechanism allows different agents to specialize in specific tasks or functions, improving the overall efficiency and capability of the system. Handoffs can be triggered by specific conditions or user requests, enabling seamless transitions between agents to handle diverse and complex workflows.
