Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object. In the context of weather forecasting, remote sensing involves using satellites and other instruments to collect data on atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and wind patterns. This data is essential for initializing and updating weather prediction models.
