The concept of treating data with the same care and intentionality as a consumer-facing product. This involves intentionally designing, building, maintaining, and measuring data to create value. A data product has a clear purpose tied to a business decision, is created for a defined audience, and is continuously evaluated for utility, reliability, and accessibility. It is thoughtfully designed, guided by deliberate lifecycle management that includes innovation, maintenance, and retirement. Each product has explicit ownership, ensuring accuracy and availability, and earns trust through consistency and quality. A Data Product is a curated, domain-specific collection of data assets that are packaged and made available for consumption by other parts of an organization. Data Products are designed to be self-serve, allowing data consumers to easily discover, access, and integrate the data they need into their applications and analytics. Each Data Product is managed by a dedicated team of data product owners who are responsible for ensuring the quality, security, and compliance of the data, as well as making decisions about how the data can be used and shared.
