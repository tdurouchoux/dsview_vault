Entropy is a fundamental concept in information theory and thermodynamics. In the context of information theory, entropy measures the uncertainty, randomness, or disorder in a set of data. It quantifies the amount of information produced by a stochastic data source. Higher entropy indicates higher uncertainty and more information content, while lower entropy indicates lower uncertainty and less information content. Entropy is crucial in data compression, machine learning, and statistical mechanics.
