The Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire (HCW) equations are a set of differential equations that describe the orbital motion of a satellite relative to a circular reference orbit in a Keplerian approximation. These equations are used to model and analyze the dynamics of satellite constellations, particularly in the context of orbital mechanics and formation flying. The HCW equations are instrumental in understanding the behavior of tightly-clustered satellite formations and the forces acting upon them.
