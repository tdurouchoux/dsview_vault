Frequency bias is a failure mode observed in large language models (LLMs) where models tend to repeatedly select the most frequently occurring actions in the context, even when those actions give low rewards. This bias is an artifact of supervised pre-training and can be mitigated using reinforcement learning (RL) as a counter-measure. Frequency bias is a significant obstacle towards effective decision-making in LLMs.
