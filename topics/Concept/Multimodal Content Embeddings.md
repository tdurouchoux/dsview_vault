Multimodal content embeddings involve combining embeddings from various modalities such as visual, textual, and audio data. These embeddings are clustered using techniques like K-means to create trainable category IDs, transforming static content embeddings into adaptable, behavior-aligned representations. This approach enhances the performance of recommendation systems by capturing a broader range of user preferences and item characteristics.
