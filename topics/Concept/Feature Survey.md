A feature survey is a systematic exploration of the features extracted from a model to understand their diversity, completeness, and categories. In the context of interpretability, a feature survey involves analyzing the local and global structure of features, identifying feature neighborhoods, and categorizing features into meaningful groups. This process helps in understanding the breadth and completeness of the features extracted from the model and in identifying interesting or safety-relevant features. A feature survey is a valuable tool for gaining insights into the model's internal representations and for guiding further investigations.
