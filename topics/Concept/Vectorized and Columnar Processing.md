Vectorized and columnar processing is a data processing technique that involves performing operations on entire columns of data at once, rather than row by row. This approach leverages modern processor architectures to achieve high performance and efficiency. Vectorized processing uses SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously, while columnar processing stores data in columns, which can be more cache-efficient and better suited for analytical queries. This technique is particularly effective in data manipulation libraries like Polars, where it enables fast and efficient data processing.
