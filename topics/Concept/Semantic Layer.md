A semantic layer extends the concept of a semantic layer by aiming to provide a consistent, accessible, and comprehensive encoding of business logic that can be utilized by any downstream analytical application. This layer is designed to be flexible and adaptable, supporting a wide range of data interaction methods and analytical tools. The goal is to create a unified framework that can be used across different platforms and tools, ensuring that business logic and data definitions are consistently applied and easily accessible. This approach aims to enhance data governance, streamline data analysis, and support various data consumption needs within an organization. It serves as an intermediary between data storage and data visualization, providing a unified view of metrics and dimensions. It allows for the declarative definition of metrics and dimensions, enabling consistent and reusable definitions across different tools and platforms. This layer helps bridge the gap between data storage, analysis, and visualization in a unified, declarative framework.
