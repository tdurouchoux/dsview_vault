A Semantic Layer serves as an intermediary between data storage and visualization, providing a declarative way to define metrics and dimensions. It allows for the extension of SQL with analytical capabilities, enabling queries to return measures (expressions) instead of values. This layer bridges the gap between data storage, analysis, and visualization, making it easier to manage and query complex data structures in a unified, declarative framework.
