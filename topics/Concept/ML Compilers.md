ML Compilers are specialized tools designed to optimize and convert machine learning models from one representation to another, often to improve performance or portability. They take models defined in high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch and convert them into forms that can be executed more efficiently on various hardware platforms, such as GPUs, CPUs, or TPUs. These compilers aim to address the unique challenges posed by the dynamic and complex nature of machine learning computation graphs.
