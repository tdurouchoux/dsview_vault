ML Compilers are tools designed to optimize and convert machine learning models from one representation to another, often to improve performance or portability. They take models defined in frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow and convert them into forms that can be executed more efficiently on various hardware platforms, such as GPUs, CPUs, or TPUs. These compilers aim to address the challenges of optimizing the large and diverse set of operations used in deep learning models.
