Lazy evaluation is a programming paradigm where expressions are not evaluated when they are called, but their evaluation is deferred until their results are needed by other expressions. In the context of Polars, lazy evaluation allows for the optimization of query plans before execution, leading to more efficient data processing. This can result in significant performance improvements, especially for complex queries involving large datasets.
