Serverless functions are a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. They allow developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers, enabling scalable and cost-effective execution of small, event-driven functions. Serverless functions are often used for tasks such as data processing, automation, and microservices.
