Semantic Text Splitting is the process of dividing text into semantically coherent chunks. This technique is useful for various NLP tasks, such as summarization, information retrieval, and text analysis. By splitting text into meaningful segments, it becomes easier to process and understand the content, especially in applications like document clustering, topic modeling, and content recommendation systems.
