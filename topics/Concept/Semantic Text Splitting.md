Semantic Text Splitting is the process of dividing a long text into semantically coherent chunks. This technique is useful for various NLP tasks, including text summarization, information retrieval, and document classification. Semantic Text Splitting ensures that the meaning and context of the text are preserved, making it easier to process and analyze. In WordLlama, semantic text splitting is achieved using word embeddings to locate more natural indexes to split on, ensuring that the resulting chunks are both semantically coherent and of a manageable size.
