Graph processing involves performing computations on graph structures, which consist of nodes (vertices) and edges. It is a critical area in data science for analyzing relationships and interactions within data. Graph processing systems are designed to handle large-scale graph computations efficiently, often leveraging distributed and parallel processing techniques to manage and process vast amounts of data.
