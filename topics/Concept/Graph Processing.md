Graph processing involves performing computations on graph structures, which consist of nodes (vertices) and edges. It is a fundamental task in data analysis and is used in various applications, such as social network analysis, recommendation systems, and network analysis. Graph processing systems aim to efficiently handle large-scale graph computations.
