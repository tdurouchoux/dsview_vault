Generative Business Intelligence (GenBI) is a paradigm shift in business intelligence that leverages generative AI to create an interactive, conversational interface for data analytics. It allows users to generate dashboards, metrics, and data models through natural language interactions, making data analytics more accessible and efficient. GenBI relies on a declarative BI stack where dashboards and metrics are defined as code, providing a structured context that AI models can understand and work with. This approach enables rapid iteration and refinement of analytics artifacts, enhancing the overall data analytics experience.
