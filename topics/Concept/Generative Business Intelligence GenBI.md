Generative Business Intelligence (GenBI) is a paradigm shift in business intelligence that leverages generative AI to create an interactive, conversational interface for data analytics. It allows users to describe their data needs in natural language and receive visualizations, dashboards, and metrics in response. GenBI relies on a declarative BI stack where dashboards and metrics are defined as code, enabling AI models to understand and work with structured definitions of business metrics, relationships, and visualizations. This approach makes data analytics more accessible and efficient, reducing the need for complex SQL queries or graphical user interfaces.
