A framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea is to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (LLM thoughts) are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. Graph of Thoughts (GoT) is a framework designed to solve complex problems by modeling them as a Graph of Operations (GoO). This approach leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as the engine to execute these operations. The framework is flexible and extensible, allowing for the implementation of various problem-solving strategies, including Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT). The main idea is to break down elaborate problems into a series of interconnected operations, which are then processed by the LLM to achieve a solution.
