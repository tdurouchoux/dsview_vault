A framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea is to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (LLM thoughts) are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. GoT is designed to be extensible with new thought transformations and can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. Graph of Thoughts (GoT) is also a framework designed to solve complex problems by modeling them as a Graph of Operations (GoO). This approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as the engine to execute these operations. GoT is flexible and extensible, allowing it to implement various problem-solving approaches, including Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The framework is particularly useful for elaborate problem-solving tasks that require structured and systematic reasoning.
