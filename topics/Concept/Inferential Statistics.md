Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that involves using data to make inferences, predictions, or generalizations about populations based on sample data. It helps in drawing conclusions or making statements about a larger group by analyzing a smaller, representative subset of that group. Key concepts include hypothesis testing, estimation, confidence intervals, statistical tests, and level of significance.
