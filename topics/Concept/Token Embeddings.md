Token embeddings are dense vector representations of tokens (words or subwords) in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic and syntactic information. They are derived from large language models (LLMs) and are used to represent text in a format that can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Token embeddings are essential for various NLP tasks, including similarity computation, ranking, clustering, and semantic text splitting. They enable efficient and accurate text processing, making them a crucial component in modern NLP toolkits like WordLlama.
