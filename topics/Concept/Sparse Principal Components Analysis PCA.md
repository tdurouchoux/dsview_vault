Sparse Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that combines the principles of principal component analysis and variable clustering to handle collinearities in data while providing a more sparse representation of the variables. This technique is useful for dimensionality reduction and identifying key patterns in high-dimensional datasets, such as patient baseline variables in medical research.
