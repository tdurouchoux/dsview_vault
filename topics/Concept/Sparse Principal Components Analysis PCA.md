Sparse PCA is a variant of principal component analysis that incorporates sparsity into the principal components. This means that the principal components are linear combinations of only a subset of the original variables, making them more interpretable. Sparse PCA is particularly useful for handling collinearities and redundancies in the data while providing a more compact representation of the variables.
