Batch invariance in the context of machine learning refers to the property where the output of a model for a given input does not depend on the batch size or the presence of other inputs in the batch. Achieving batch invariance ensures that the model's behavior is consistent and predictable, regardless of how inputs are grouped or processed in batches.
