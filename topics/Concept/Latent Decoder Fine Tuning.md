Latent decoder fine-tuning is a process used to improve the visual quality of frames generated by diffusion models. It involves training the decoder of a pre-trained auto-encoder using an MSE loss computed against target frame pixels. This fine-tuning leverages pre-trained knowledge while enhancing image quality, particularly in small details and the heads-up display (HUD). Fine-tuning the latent decoder separately from the U-Net improves the overall fidelity of the generated frames without affecting the auto-regressive generation process.
