Latent decoder fine-tuning involves fine-tuning the decoder part of a pre-trained auto-encoder to improve the visual quality of generated frames. This process is separate from the U-Net fine-tuning and focuses on enhancing small details and specific elements like the heads-up display (HUD) in game frames. Fine-tuning the latent decoder leverages pre-trained knowledge while adapting it to the specific requirements of the task, resulting in higher fidelity visual details.
