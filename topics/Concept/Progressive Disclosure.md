Progressive Disclosure is a design principle used in Agent Skills that allows agents to load information incrementally. It starts with metadata in a SKILL.md file, followed by more detailed instructions in additional files, which the agent loads only when necessary. This approach helps manage the context window efficiently, enabling agents to handle large amounts of information without overloading their immediate context.
