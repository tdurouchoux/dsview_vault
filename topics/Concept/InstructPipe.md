InstructPipe is a research prototype designed to enable visual programming users to generate AI pipelines from human instructions. It automates node selection and connection, making it easier for users to create machine learning pipelines through a visual programming framework. The system uses large language models (LLMs) and a code interpreter to generate pseudocode for the desired pipeline, which is then rendered in a visual editor for human-AI collaboration.
