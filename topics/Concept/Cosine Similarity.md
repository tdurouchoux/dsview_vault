Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It is often used to measure document similarity in text analysis. The cosine of the angle between the vectors is a value between -1 and 1, where 1 means the vectors are identical in direction, 0 means they are orthogonal (no similarity), and -1 means they are opposite in direction. It is commonly used in text mining and information retrieval.
