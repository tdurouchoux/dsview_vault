Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors in an inner product space. It is often used to measure how similar two documents are, based on the cosine of the angle between the vectors. Cosine similarity is particularly useful in high-dimensional positive spaces, such as text analysis, where the magnitude of the vectors does not matter, but the orientation does.
