Semantic similarity metrics are used to measure the similarity between two texts based on their meanings rather than just their surface-level features. These metrics rely on contextualized embeddings, which represent the semantics of the texts as feature vectors. Common semantic similarity metrics include BERTScore, MoverScore, and Sentence Mover Similarity (SMS). These metrics compute the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the texts to measure their similarity. While semantic similarity metrics are simple and fast to compute, they can have poor correlation with human evaluators and may suffer from issues such as lack of interpretability, inherent bias, poor adaptability, and the inability to capture subtle nuances in language.
