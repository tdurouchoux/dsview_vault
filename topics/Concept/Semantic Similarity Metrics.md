Semantic similarity metrics are evaluation methods used to measure the similarity between two texts based on their meaning rather than just their surface-level features. These metrics rely on contextualized embeddings to capture the semantics of the texts. Common semantic similarity metrics include BERTScore, MoverScore, and Sentence Mover Similarity (SMS). These metrics compute the cosine similarity between embedding vectors representing the texts, providing a measure of how closely related their meanings are. Semantic similarity metrics are useful for tasks such as text classification, information retrieval, and natural language inference.
