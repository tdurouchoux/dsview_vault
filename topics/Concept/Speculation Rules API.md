The Speculation Rules API is a feature designed to improve navigation performance by prefetching or prerendering future navigations. It allows developers to specify rules for which URLs should be prefetched or prerendered, thereby reducing latency and improving user experience. The API includes various settings and conditions to manage the speculation process efficiently.
