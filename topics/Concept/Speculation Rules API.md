The Speculation Rules API is a feature used to improve navigation performance by prefetching or prerendering future navigations. It allows developers to specify which URLs should be prefetched or prerendered, and under what conditions. The API includes various settings such as eagerness levels and document rules to control when and how speculation should occur. This helps in reducing latency and improving the user experience by loading pages faster when users navigate to them.
