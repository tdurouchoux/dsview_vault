Statistical power is the probability that a statistical test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. It depends on the effect size, sample size, and significance level (alpha). Higher power increases the likelihood of detecting a true effect, reducing the risk of Type II errors. Power analysis is essential for determining the appropriate sample size to achieve reliable results in research studies. Understanding power helps researchers design studies that are more likely to yield meaningful and reproducible findings.
