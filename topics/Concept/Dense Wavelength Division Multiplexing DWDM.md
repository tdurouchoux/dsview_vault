Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is a technology used in optical communications to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously over a single optical fiber or free-space link. By using different wavelengths of light for each data stream, DWDM significantly increases the bandwidth and capacity of the communication channel. This technology is essential for achieving the high-bandwidth inter-satellite links required for scalable AI compute in space.
