Discrete program search is a method used in AI to find solutions to problems by searching through a space of discrete programs or algorithms. This approach involves combining primitive program elements into more complex programs to solve specific tasks. Discrete program search is particularly effective for tasks that require reasoning and problem-solving, such as those in the ARC benchmark. It is considered a promising alternative to deep learning for achieving more general and adaptable AI systems.
