Floating-point non-associativity refers to the property of floating-point arithmetic where the order of operations affects the result due to rounding errors and finite precision. This means that expressions like (a + b) + c may not equal a + (b + c) when using floating-point numbers, leading to potential inaccuracies in computations, particularly in iterative or parallel processing environments.
