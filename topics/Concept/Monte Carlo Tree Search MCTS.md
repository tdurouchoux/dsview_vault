Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm used for decision-making in environments with a high branching factor, such as game playing or planning. It works by building a tree of possible actions and simulating outcomes to find the most optimal path. In the context of AI agents, MCTS helps agents decide the best sequence of actions to achieve a goal, such as navigating a webpage or completing a task. The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation to improve decision-making over time.
