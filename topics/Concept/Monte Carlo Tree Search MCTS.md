Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is an algorithm used for decision-making in complex environments, particularly in AI and game-playing systems. It works by simulating multiple possible future states (a 'tree' of possibilities) and using random sampling (Monte Carlo simulation) to evaluate the outcomes. This helps in identifying the most optimal path or action to take, balancing exploration and exploitation of potential strategies.
