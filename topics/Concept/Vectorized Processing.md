Vectorized processing is a technique used in data manipulation where operations are applied to entire columns of data at once, rather than row by row. This approach leverages the SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) capabilities of modern processors to achieve significant performance improvements. Vectorized processing is particularly effective in columnar data formats, as it allows for efficient data access patterns and reduces the overhead of iterative operations.
