ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a reference-based metric used to evaluate the quality of generated text, particularly in summarization tasks. ROUGE measures the recall of the generated text by comparing it to a reference text. The most popular variants of ROUGE are ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L. ROUGE-N measures the number of matching n-grams between the reference and the generated text, while ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the two texts. ROUGE scores are calculated based on precision, recall, and the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
