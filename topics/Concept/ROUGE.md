ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) is a set of metrics used for evaluating the quality of text summarization and machine translation tasks. ROUGE measures the recall of n-grams, which are contiguous sequences of n items from a given sample of text, between a candidate summary and a set of reference summaries. The most commonly used ROUGE metrics are ROUGE-N, which measures the overlap of n-grams, and ROUGE-L, which measures the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the candidate and reference summaries. ROUGE scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better quality. ROUGE is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks to assess the performance of summarization models.
