Unsupervised learning with GNNs involves training GNNs without labeled data to compute a continuous representation or embedding of the discrete graph structure of nodes and their features. These representations can then be utilized in other machine learning systems, allowing the discrete, relational information encoded by a graph to be included in more typical neural network use cases. TF-GNN supports a fine-grained specification of unsupervised objectives for heterogeneous graphs.
