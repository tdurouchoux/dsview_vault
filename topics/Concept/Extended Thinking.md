Extended thinking refers to the capability of AI models to engage in deeper, more reflective reasoning processes. This can involve multi-step reasoning, planning, and iterating based on new information, especially after tool use. This feature is present in advanced AI models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and improves performance on complex tasks such as math, physics, instruction-following, and coding by enabling the model to self-reflect and consider multiple aspects of a problem before providing an answer.
