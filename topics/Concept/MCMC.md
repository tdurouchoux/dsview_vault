Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a method for sampling from a probability distribution and building Bayesian models based on it. It is particularly useful for high-dimensional and complex distributions where direct sampling is difficult. MCMC algorithms construct a Markov chain that has the desired distribution as its equilibrium distribution, allowing for the generation of samples from the posterior distribution of Bayesian models.
