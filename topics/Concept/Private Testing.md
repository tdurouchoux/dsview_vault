Private testing in the context of AI model evaluations refers to the practice where certain providers are allowed to test multiple model variants privately before publicly releasing only the best-performing checkpoint. This practice can lead to selective disclosure of performance results, skewing the leaderboard rankings and creating an unfair advantage for those who can engage in extensive private testing. It underscores the need for transparency and equitable evaluation practices in AI model assessments.
