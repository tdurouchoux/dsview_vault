Python keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the Python language. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python code. Keywords cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Examples of Python keywords include 'if', 'else', 'for', 'while', 'def', 'class', 'import', 'return', and 'try'. These keywords are essential for controlling the flow of a program, defining functions and classes, handling exceptions, and more.
