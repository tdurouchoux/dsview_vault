Python keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes within the Python language. They are used to define the syntax and structure of Python code. Examples include 'def' for defining functions, 'class' for defining classes, 'if' for conditional statements, and 'for' for loops. These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers.
