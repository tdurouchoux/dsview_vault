A method that allows AI agents to interact with MCP servers more efficiently by writing and executing code. This approach enables agents to load only the necessary tools, process data within the execution environment, and reduce token usage, thereby improving efficiency and reducing costs. It leverages familiar programming constructs to handle tasks that would otherwise consume excessive tokens if done through direct tool calls.
