Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are a standardized assessment method used globally in medical education to evaluate clinical skills and competencies. In the context of AMIE's evaluation, OSCEs involve validated patient actors engaging in conversations with AMIE or primary care physicians through a chat interface, where they can upload multimodal artifacts such as images. The OSCE framework assesses AMIE's performance on various clinical criteria, including diagnostic accuracy, information gathering effectiveness, management plan appropriateness, and safety. This method provides a structured and objective way to compare AMIE's capabilities with those of human clinicians, ensuring rigorous and meaningful evaluations.
