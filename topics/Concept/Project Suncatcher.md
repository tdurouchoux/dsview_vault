Project Suncatcher is a moonshot initiative by Google that aims to explore the feasibility of equipping solar-powered satellite constellations with TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and free-space optical links to scale machine learning compute in space. The project envisions a future where AI infrastructure is highly scalable and operates in space, leveraging the abundant solar energy available in certain orbits to reduce dependency on terrestrial resources.
