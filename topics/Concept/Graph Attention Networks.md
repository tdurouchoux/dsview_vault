Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are a type of Graph Neural Network that uses attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes when updating node embeddings. GATs assign weights to edges based on a scoring function that measures the relevance of neighboring nodes to the central node. These weights are normalized and used to compute a weighted sum of the neighboring node features. GATs are permutation-invariant and can be used for tasks like node classification and link prediction.
