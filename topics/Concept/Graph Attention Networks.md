Graph Attention Networks (GAT) is an algorithm that supports representation learning and node classification for homogeneous graphs. GAT uses attention mechanisms to aggregate feature information from neighbor nodes, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant neighbors for each node. This attention mechanism makes GAT highly effective for tasks where the importance of neighbors varies significantly across the graph. StellarGraph provides implementations of GAT that support both sparse and dense adjacency matrices.
