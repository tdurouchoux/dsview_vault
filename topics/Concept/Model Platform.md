A model platform is a system that concerns the packaging, deployment, and serving of models. It typically includes a model deployment API for packaging trained models with necessary dependencies, a model registry for storing and versioning models, and a prediction service for retrieving models and generating predictions. The goal is to make model deployment self-serve, allowing data scientists to deploy models without needing to hand them off to engineering teams.
