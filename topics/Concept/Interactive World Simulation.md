Interactive World Simulation refers to the process of simulating an interactive environment where a model generates observations based on a sequence of actions. This involves maintaining a latent state, projecting it to observations, and transitioning states based on actions. The goal is to minimize the distance between simulated and real observations, ensuring the simulation remains stable and realistic over time. This concept is crucial for applications like game engines and interactive virtual environments.
