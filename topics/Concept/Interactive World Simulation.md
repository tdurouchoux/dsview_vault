Interactive World Simulation refers to the process of creating a simulation distribution function that generates observations conditioned on past observations and actions. It involves defining an interactive environment with states, observations, actions, and transition probabilities. The goal is to minimize the distance between observations from the environment and the simulation, using metrics like PSNR and LPIPS. This concept is crucial for developing models that can simulate complex environments interactively and accurately.
