Multimodality in the context of AI models refers to the ability to process and generate outputs from multiple types of input data, such as text, images, and videos. Multimodal capabilities refer to the ability of a model to process and translate text within images, in addition to traditional text translation. TranslateGemma models retain the strong multimodal capabilities of Gemma 3, allowing them to translate text within images without specific multimodal fine-tuning during the training process. This is demonstrated through tests on the Vistra image translation benchmark. Gemma 3's multimodal capabilities allow it to handle vision-language inputs and produce text outputs, making it versatile for various applications requiring the integration of different data types.
