Multimodality in the context of AI models refers to the ability to process and generate outputs from multiple types of input data, such as text, images, and audio. Multimodal models are designed to integrate these various data types into a unified embedding space, enabling powerful applications like text-to-image generation, image captioning, and more. Examples of multimodal models include CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and LLaVA. By leveraging different modalities, these models can perform complex tasks that require understanding and generating content across various data types, making them highly versatile and useful in numerous applications.
