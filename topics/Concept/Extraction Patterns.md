Extraction Patterns are methodologies used to pull data from a source system in a data pipeline. Common extraction patterns include time-ranged pulls, full snapshots, lookback, and streaming. Time-ranged pulls extract data for a specific time frame, while full snapshots pull the entire dataset. Lookback pulls aggregate metrics for past periods, and streaming processes data in real-time. Each pattern has its pros and cons, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the data pipeline.
