Self-Improving Language Models are models that can enhance their own performance through various techniques without extensive human intervention. This includes methods like self-instruction, self-play, and self-rewarding. These techniques allow the models to generate their own training data, refine their responses, and improve their reasoning capabilities through iterative processes.
