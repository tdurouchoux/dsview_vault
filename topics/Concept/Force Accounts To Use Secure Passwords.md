Forcing accounts to use secure passwords involves configuring the system to enforce strong password policies. This is done by using the pam_pwquality module to set requirements for password complexity, such as minimum length, character diversity, and avoiding common passwords. This measure helps to prevent users from setting weak passwords that are easily guessable or vulnerable to brute-force attacks. By enforcing strong password policies, the system can better protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
