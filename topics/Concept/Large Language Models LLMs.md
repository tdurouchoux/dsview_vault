Advanced AI models capable of generating human-like text based on input prompts. They are trained on vast amounts of data and can perform a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and more. LLMs are central to the Graph of Thoughts framework, which leverages their capabilities to model complex reasoning processes.
