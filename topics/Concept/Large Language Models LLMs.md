Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to learn the patterns and structures of human language. LLMs can perform a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. They are particularly powerful because they can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, making them useful in applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation.
