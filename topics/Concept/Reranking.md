Reranking is a method employed in information retrieval systems to improve the relevance of search results. It involves using a reranking model, often referred to as a cross-encoder, to assess the similarity between each query-document pair. This allows for the rearrangement of documents according to their relevance to the query, enhancing the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the retrieval process.
