Text conditioning is a technique used in text-to-image models to generate images based on text prompts. It involves embedding both text and images into a shared space, allowing the model to generate images that correspond to the given text. Techniques like CLIP and autoregressive transformers are used to achieve this alignment, enabling the generation of images from textual descriptions.
