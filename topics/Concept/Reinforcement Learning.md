A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve maximum cumulative reward. In the context of MLGym, it is used for training agents on AI research tasks. In the context of LLMs, RL is used to fine-tune models by providing rewards for desired behaviors. This can include accuracy rewards for correct answers and format rewards for adhering to specific response structures. RL can be used in conjunction with supervised fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a training method used to improve the performance of language models by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones. It is also a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve cumulative rewards. In the context of DeepSeek-R1, RL is used to create an interim reasoning model and to further refine the model's capabilities in both reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. This method allows the model to learn from automatic verification processes, enhancing its problem-solving abilities. It involves learning from the consequences of actions, often using trial and error methods, and is applied in robotics, game playing, and resource management.
