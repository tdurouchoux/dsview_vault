A search method that focuses on understanding the meaning and context of the search query and the data being searched, rather than just matching keywords. Semantic search uses vector embeddings to represent the semantic meaning of data, allowing for more accurate and relevant search results. This approach is particularly useful for applications that require understanding the context and intent behind user queries.
