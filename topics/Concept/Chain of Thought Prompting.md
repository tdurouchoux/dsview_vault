Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where intermediate steps of reasoning are included within the prompt, besides the task input/output. This approach significantly improves the capability of LLMs to solve problems without resorting to any model updates. CoT is a foundational concept in the development of more advanced prompting schemes like GoT.
