Structured Streaming is a scalable, fault-tolerant stream processing system built on the Spark SQL engine. It allows for processing of continuous data streams while providing the same programming model as batch processing. This enables developers to express streaming computations with high-level APIs, making it easier to process and analyze real-time data streams.
