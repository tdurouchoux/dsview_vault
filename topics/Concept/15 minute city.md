The 15-minute city is an urban planning concept aimed at creating cities where residents can access essential services, such as grocery stores, schools, healthcare facilities, and parks, within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from their homes. This concept promotes walkability, reduces reliance on cars, and enhances the overall quality of life by making cities more livable and sustainable.
