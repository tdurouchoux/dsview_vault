Simplified Graph Convolutional network (SGC) is an extension of the GCN algorithm that supports representation learning and node classification for homogeneous graphs. SGC simplifies the GCN architecture by removing non-linearities and weight matrices between convolutional layers, which speeds up the training process and reduces the risk of overfitting. This makes SGC particularly suitable for large-scale graph data where computational efficiency is crucial.
