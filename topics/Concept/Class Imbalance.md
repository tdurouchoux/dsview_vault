Class imbalance refers to a situation in machine learning where the classes in a dataset are not equally represented. This can lead to models that are biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance on the minority class. Techniques to address class imbalance include resampling methods like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class, adjusting class weights, or using different evaluation metrics that are less sensitive to class distribution.
