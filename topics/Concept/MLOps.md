MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a paradigm that includes best practices, sets of concepts, and a development culture aimed at the end-to-end conceptualization, implementation, monitoring, deployment, and scalability of machine learning products. It leverages principles such as CI/CD automation, workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, continuous ML training and evaluation, ML metadata tracking and logging, continuous monitoring, and feedback loops. MLOps bridges the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) by integrating machine learning, software engineering (especially DevOps), and data engineering to facilitate the creation of robust and scalable machine learning products.
