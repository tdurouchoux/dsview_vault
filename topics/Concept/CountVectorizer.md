CountVectorizer is a feature extraction technique used to convert a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. It is used in BERTopic to create a word-document matrix, which is then used to identify the most representative words for each topic. CountVectorizer can be customized to remove stop words, apply lemmatization, and consider n-grams.
