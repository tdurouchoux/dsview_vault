AI Music refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies to create, produce, and enhance musical content. This includes generating melodies, harmonies, and even entire compositions autonomously or with human collaboration. AI Music leverages machine learning algorithms to understand patterns in existing music, enabling the creation of new pieces that can mimic various styles and genres. It also involves tools and platforms that allow musicians and producers to utilize AI to assist in the creative process, from composition to mixing and mastering. AI Music can range from simple algorithmic generation of background scores to complex, emotionally resonant compositions that challenge traditional notions of authorship and creativity.
