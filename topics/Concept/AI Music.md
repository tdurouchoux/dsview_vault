AI Music refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies to create, generate, or enhance musical content. This can include composing new music, generating lyrics, or even producing entire songs. AI music leverages machine learning algorithms to understand patterns in existing music and generate new, original pieces. It can also be used to personalize music experiences for individual listeners based on their preferences and behavior.
