Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a training method used to improve the performance of language models by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones. It is also a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve cumulative rewards. In the context of DeepSeek-R1, RL is used to create an interim reasoning model and to further refine the model's capabilities in both reasoning and non-reasoning tasks. This method allows the model to learn from automatic verification processes, enhancing its problem-solving abilities. It involves learning from the consequences of actions, often using trial and error methods, and is applied in robotics, game playing, and resource management.
