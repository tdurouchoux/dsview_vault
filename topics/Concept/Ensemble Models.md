A machine learning technique that combines multiple models to improve overall performance. Ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and stacking can reduce variance, bias, and improve predictions by leveraging the strengths of different models. Ensembles are particularly useful when dealing with complex datasets and can lead to more robust and accurate predictions.
