Behavioral Patterns in data pipelines define how the pipeline behaves in case of failures and reruns. These patterns ensure that the pipeline can recover from errors and maintain data consistency. Examples include idempotent pipelines, which produce the same output for the same input regardless of the number of runs, and self-healing pipelines, which automatically catch up on unprocessed data after a failure. These patterns help in maintaining the reliability and robustness of data pipelines.
