Bayesian statistics is a framework for statistical inference that updates the probability of a hypothesis as evidence or information becomes available. It incorporates prior knowledge or beliefs about the parameters of a model and updates these beliefs using data to obtain a posterior distribution. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where prior information is available and can be combined with observed data to make more informed decisions.
