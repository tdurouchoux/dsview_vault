Disambiguation is a technique used to clarify ambiguous user queries in text-to-SQL systems. It involves identifying when a question is not clear enough to be answered accurately with the available schema and data, and then generating follow-up questions to clarify the user's intent. This technique is particularly important for ensuring that the generated SQL queries are precise and correct, especially for less technical users who may not understand SQL.
