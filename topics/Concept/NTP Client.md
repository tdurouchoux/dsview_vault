An NTP (Network Time Protocol) client is a software component that synchronizes the system clock of a computer with a time server. This ensures that the system clock is accurate and consistent with other systems. The NTP client periodically connects to a time server to adjust the system clock, compensating for any drift or inaccuracies. This is important for security protocols that rely on accurate time stamps, as well as for logging and auditing purposes. The NTP client can be configured to use specific time servers and to adjust the system clock automatically.
