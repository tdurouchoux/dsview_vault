The metrics layer is a critical component of the BI stack that provides a centralized, declarative definition of business metrics and their relationships. It serves as a semantic layer that captures the business logic behind metrics, including aggregations, transformations, and relationships between data dimensions. The metrics layer is essential for GenBI, as it provides the semantic context that AI models need to understand and generate BI artifacts. By centralizing business definitions in code, the metrics layer ensures consistency and accuracy in the interpretation of business logic across the organization.
