A metrics layer is a specialized component within a data architecture that focuses on defining, storing, and managing business metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). It provides a centralized repository for metric definitions, ensuring consistency and reusability across different analytical tools and applications. The metrics layer typically includes formulas, calculations, and business logic that describe how metrics should be computed from raw data. By abstracting these definitions, the metrics layer enables business users to access and utilize metrics without needing to understand the underlying data structures or transformations. This layer is often a subset of a broader semantic layer, focusing specifically on the computational aspects of business metrics and serves as a semantic layer that captures the business logic behind metrics, including aggregations, transformations, and relationships between data dimensions. The metrics layer is essential for GenBI, as it provides the semantic context that AI models need to understand and generate BI artifacts. By centralizing business definitions in code, the metrics layer ensures consistency and accuracy in the interpretation of business logic across the organization.
