RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback with Variance Reduction) is an advanced technique in reinforcement learning that incorporates human feedback to improve the learning process. It focuses on reducing variance in the learning signals, making the training more stable and efficient, particularly in complex environments where traditional reinforcement learning methods may struggle with high variability in rewards or feedback.
