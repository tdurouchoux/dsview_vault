Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a process where a pre-trained language model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on particular tasks. In the context of reasoning models, SFT involves training the model on datasets that include examples of complex reasoning tasks and their solutions. This helps the model learn to generate intermediate reasoning steps and improve its accuracy on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. It is a method used to adapt pre-trained language models to specific tasks using labeled data. It involves fine-tuning the model on a dataset where the input-output pairs are known, allowing the model to learn to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
