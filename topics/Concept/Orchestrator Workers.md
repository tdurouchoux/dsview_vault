The orchestrator-workers workflow is a pattern where a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where the subtasks needed cannot be predicted in advance. The orchestrator determines the subtasks based on the specific input, providing flexibility in task execution.
