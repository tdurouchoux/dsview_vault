The orchestrator-workers workflow involves a central LLM that dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. This method is well-suited for complex tasks where the subtasks needed cannot be predicted in advance. It is characterized by its flexibility, as subtasks are determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.
