Guard Fine-tuning is a rapid response technique that involves fine-tuning an input classifier to block proliferated jailbreaks. This method uses a small set of observed jailbreak examples to generate additional similar examples, which are then used to train the classifier. The goal is to reduce the attack success rate of jailbreaks by improving the classifier's ability to identify and block these attacks.
