Guard Fine-tuning is a rapid response technique that involves fine-tuning an input classifier to block proliferated jailbreaks. This method reduces the attack success rate by adapting the classifier to new examples of jailbreak attacks. It is one of the most effective methods evaluated in RapidResponseBench, showing significant reductions in attack success rates with minimal increases in refusal rates on benign queries.
