Powerful AI refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that possess capabilities far surpassing current AI technologies. These systems are envisioned to have intelligence levels comparable to or exceeding human experts across multiple domains, including biology, programming, mathematics, engineering, and writing. Powerful AI is characterized by its ability to perform complex tasks autonomously, interact with the physical world through various interfaces, and operate at speeds significantly faster than human capabilities. The development and deployment of such AI systems are expected to have profound impacts on scientific progress, economic development, and societal structures.
