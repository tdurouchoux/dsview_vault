Powerful AI refers to advanced artificial intelligence systems that possess capabilities far exceeding those of current AI technologies. These systems are envisioned to have human-like or superhuman intelligence, enabling them to perform complex tasks across various domains such as biology, programming, mathematics, engineering, and writing. Powerful AI is expected to interact with the world through multiple interfaces, including text, audio, video, and internet access, and to operate autonomously on tasks that require hours, days, or weeks to complete. The development of powerful AI is anticipated to have profound implications for scientific progress, economic development, and societal transformation.
