Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) is a task that involves detecting, segmenting, and tracking all instances of a visual concept specified by a short text phrase, image exemplars, or a combination of both. This task is designed to handle simple noun phrases and supports interactive refinement to resolve ambiguities and improve segmentation accuracy.
