Label propagation is an algorithm used for graph connectivity, where each vertex in a graph maintains a label. The algorithm iteratively updates the label of each vertex to be the minimum of its current label and the labels of its neighbors. This process continues until the labels converge, indicating that all vertices within a connected component have the same label. Label propagation is commonly used in community detection and other graph-based analyses.
