High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of memory used in modern GPUs to store large datasets and model weights efficiently. HBM provides fast access to data, which is crucial for high-performance computing tasks like matrix multiplications and neural network training. The capacity and bandwidth of HBM vary by GPU model, with higher-end models like the NVIDIA H100 and B200 offering larger capacities and higher bandwidths. Efficient use of HBM is essential for optimizing the performance of machine learning models and other data-intensive applications.
