Code linters and static analyzers are tools that help identify potential issues in your code by analyzing the source code without executing it. They can catch common programming errors, enforce coding standards, and provide valuable suggestions for improvement. They can be used in various programming languages, such as R, and can help ensure that the code follows a consistent style, making it easier to read and maintain.
