The Conformer architecture is a type of neural network architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with Transformer models. It is particularly effective for speech recognition tasks, leveraging the strengths of both CNNs for local feature extraction and Transformers for global feature modeling. This architecture is well-suited for applications requiring high accuracy in speech-to-text transcription, such as MedASR.
