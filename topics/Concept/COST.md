COST, or the Configuration that Outperforms a Single Thread, is a new metric for big data platforms. It measures the hardware configuration required for a platform to outperform a competent single-threaded implementation. This metric helps evaluate the actual performance gains of a system by weighing its scalability against the overheads it introduces.
