Distillabel is a tool used to generate synthetic data for training machine learning models. It was employed in the development of Ichigo to create diverse synthetic answers for handling inaudible inputs. By using Distillabel, the researchers were able to generate a wide range of appropriate "decline" responses, enhancing the model's ability to manage inaudible speech inputs effectively.
