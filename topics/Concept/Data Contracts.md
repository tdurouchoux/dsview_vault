Data contracts are formal agreements that define the responsibilities and expectations between data producers and consumers within an organization. They ensure that changes in data are explicitly documented, communicated, and managed, thereby maintaining data quality and reliability. Data contracts include governance mechanisms such as control and communication, which are integrated into the tools used by teams to facilitate natural adoption of good governance practices.
