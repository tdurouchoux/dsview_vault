Data contracts are formal agreements that define the responsibilities and expectations between data producers and consumers within an organization. They ensure that changes in data are explicitly documented, communicated to relevant stakeholders, and managed to assess their operational impact. These contracts incorporate governance mechanisms such as control and communication, anchoring them in the tools used by teams to facilitate the adoption of good governance practices.
