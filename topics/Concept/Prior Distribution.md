A prior distribution in Bayesian statistics represents the initial beliefs or knowledge about the parameters of a model before data is observed. It encapsulates what is known or assumed about the parameters prior to conducting an experiment or analysis. The prior distribution is updated with new data to form the posterior distribution, which reflects the updated beliefs about the parameters.
