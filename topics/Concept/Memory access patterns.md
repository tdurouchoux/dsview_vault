Memory access patterns refer to the way in which data is accessed from memory, which can have a significant impact on performance. Sequential access patterns, where data is accessed in a linear order, are generally more cache-friendly and can lead to better performance. In contrast, random access patterns, where data is accessed in a non-linear order, can result in more cache misses and slower performance. Understanding and optimizing memory access patterns is crucial for improving the performance of both low-level and high-level languages.
