Memory access patterns refer to the way in which a program accesses data in memory. These patterns can be sequential, random, or a combination of both. The efficiency of memory access patterns can have a significant impact on performance, particularly in relation to CPU caching. Understanding and optimizing memory access patterns is crucial for writing efficient code, especially in languages where direct control over memory layout is limited.
