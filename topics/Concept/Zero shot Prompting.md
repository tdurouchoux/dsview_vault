Zero-shot prompting is a technique in natural language processing where a model is given a task or question it has not been explicitly trained on, and it generates a response based on its general understanding and knowledge. This approach allows the model to handle new and unseen tasks without additional training, leveraging its ability to generalize from the data it was trained on.
