Open Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI models designed for natural language processing tasks, made available for commercial use under permissive licenses such as Apache 2.0, MIT, or OpenRAIL-M. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can be fine-tuned for various applications, including text generation, translation, and coding assistance. They are often released with accompanying datasets and evaluation benchmarks to facilitate further research and development.
