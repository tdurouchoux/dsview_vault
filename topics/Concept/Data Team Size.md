Data Team Size refers to the number of data professionals within an organization, often compared to the total company size. It is a metric used to understand the scale and capacity of a company's data operations relative to its overall workforce. This can include roles such as data scientists, data engineers, data analysts, and machine learning engineers. The ratio of data team size to total company size can provide insights into how much a company invests in data-driven decision-making and technology.
