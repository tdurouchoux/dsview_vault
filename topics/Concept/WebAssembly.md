WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages like C, C++, and Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client-side execution at near-native speed, facilitating tasks that were previously not feasible in JavaScript alone.
