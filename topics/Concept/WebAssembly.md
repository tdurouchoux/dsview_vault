WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client-side scripting. WebAssembly allows for high-performance execution of code written in various languages, including Python, directly in web browsers. It is particularly useful for running computationally intensive tasks in a web environment without the need for a server backend.
