Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human language. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can perform a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering. LLMs are known for their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text, making them highly useful in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and content creation.
