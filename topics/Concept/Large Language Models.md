Large language models are a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast amounts of training data. These models are used in various applications, including chatbots, content generation, and more. The training of these models often involves using large datasets, which can sometimes include copyrighted material. They are trained on vast amounts of data and can perform a wide range of tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and more. LLMs are central to the Graph of Thoughts framework, which leverages their capabilities to model complex reasoning processes.
