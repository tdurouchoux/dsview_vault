Plan Mode is a feature in VS Code that helps developers plan and structure their tasks before implementation. It works with Copilot to ask clarifying questions and build a step-by-step approach for the task. Plan Mode ensures that the necessary context is provided upfront, improving the effectiveness of AI assistance and helping to identify potential gaps or issues early in the development process.
