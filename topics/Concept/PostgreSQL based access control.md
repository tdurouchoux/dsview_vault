PostgreSQL-based access control refers to the method of managing user permissions and access to databases using the built-in role and privilege system of PostgreSQL. This approach allows administrators to define who can view, edit, or manage data within the database, ensuring that access is secure and aligned with organizational policies. Mathesar leverages this feature to provide secure data access within its interface, utilizing existing PostgreSQL roles and privileges to control user actions and data visibility.
