Structured data extraction is the process of converting unstructured or semi-structured data into a structured format, such as tables or databases. This involves identifying and extracting relevant information from the data and organizing it according to a predefined schema. Structured data extraction is essential for data analysis and integration workflows, as it enables easy manipulation, querying, and analysis of the data.
