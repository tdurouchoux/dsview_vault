Misleading varieties in data visualization refer to chart designs that, while technically correct, can mislead or distort the interpretation of the data. These varieties often result from poor design choices, such as improper scaling, misleading visual encodings, or the omission of critical context. Common examples include truncated axes, misleading color choices, and the use of dual-axis charts without clear justification. Recognizing and understanding these misleading varieties is essential for both creators and consumers of data visualizations to ensure accurate and honest communication of information.
