A foundation model in the context of open-source projects refers to a structure where a non-profit foundation manages the intellectual property and development of the open-source project, while commercial entities contribute to and benefit from the project's ecosystem. This model aims to ensure the long-term sustainability and open access to the project, fostering community contributions and innovation.
