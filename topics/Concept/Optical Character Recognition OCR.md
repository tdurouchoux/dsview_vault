Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. OCR technology analyzes the structure of the image of the document to identify and recognize the text, numbers, and other characters within it. This process is essential for converting printed or handwritten text into digital formats that can be processed by computers.
