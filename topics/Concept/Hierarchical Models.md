Hierarchical models are statistical models that account for the nested structure of data, where observations are grouped at multiple levels. These models share information across related groups, improving parameter estimation through a regularization effect known as shrinkage. This is particularly useful in time series forecasting where trend and seasonality components can be better estimated by leveraging information from related groups, such as different regions or product categories.
