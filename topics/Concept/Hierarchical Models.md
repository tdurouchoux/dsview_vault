Hierarchical models are statistical models that incorporate a hierarchical structure, allowing information sharing across related groups. This approach improves model performance by regularizing parameter estimation, particularly useful in scenarios with a hierarchical structure such as category levels or region groupings. In time series forecasting, hierarchical models can better estimate trend and seasonality components by leveraging the information-sharing nature of the hierarchical structure.
