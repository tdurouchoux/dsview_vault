In DSPy, a module is a component that applies specific prompt techniques to generate prompts and run them against an LLM. Modules like Predict, ChainOfThought, and ReAct provide different strategies for contextualizing and reformatting signatures to achieve better results from the LLM. Modules can be optimized and combined to form more complex prompting chains.
