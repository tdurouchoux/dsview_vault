Malloy is a relational modeling language designed to simplify the process of defining and querying data models. It provides a high-level, declarative syntax for specifying data relationships, transformations, and aggregations, making it easier for analysts to work with complex data structures. Malloy is particularly useful for creating and managing semantic layers, as it allows users to define business logic, metrics, and data relationships in a way that is both intuitive and powerful. By abstracting the underlying SQL and data transformations, Malloy enables analysts to focus on the logical structure of their data models, improving productivity and collaboration.
