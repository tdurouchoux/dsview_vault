In the context of AI interpretability, a circuit refers to a group of interconnected features or neurons within a model that perform a specific cognitive task or function. Circuits represent the steps in a model's thinking process, showing how concepts emerge from input, interact to form new concepts, and generate actions. Identifying and understanding these circuits is essential for tracing and manipulating the model's reasoning, thereby enhancing interpretability and safety.
