An Isotropic Gaussian distribution is a multivariate normal distribution where the covariance matrix is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, indicating that the variance is the same in all directions. This property simplifies many statistical analyses and is often assumed in models like PPCA to ensure that the noise term does not favor any particular direction in the data space.
