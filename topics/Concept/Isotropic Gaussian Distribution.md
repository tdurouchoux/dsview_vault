An Isotropic Gaussian distribution is a multivariate normal distribution where the covariance matrix is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, indicating that the variance is the same in all directions. In the context of PPCA, assuming that the noise term follows an Isotropic Gaussian distribution ensures that the probabilistic principal components are closely related to the classical principal components, making PPCA a useful technique for dimensionality reduction.
