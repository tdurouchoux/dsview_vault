LangGraph is a framework designed for creating modular, graph-based AI workflows. It allows developers to build complex AI agents by defining nodes and edges in a graph structure, enabling state management and orchestration of multi-step processes. LangGraph is particularly useful for applications that require sophisticated workflows and state tracking.
