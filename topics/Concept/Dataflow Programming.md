Dataflow programming is a programming paradigm that treats data as flowing through a series of transformations. In Marimo, dataflow programming is used to ensure that changes in one part of the notebook automatically propagate through dependent cells, maintaining a consistent state. This paradigm is central to Marimo's reactive and deterministic execution model.
