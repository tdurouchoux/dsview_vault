Time-Series Forecasting involves predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. This is used for various applications such as demand forecasting, stock price prediction, and weather forecasting. Time Series Prediction involves using historical data points indexed in time order to forecast future values. It leverages the temporal dependency between data points to identify patterns and trends, which are then used to make predictions. This technique is widely applied in various fields such as finance, weather forecasting, and inventory management.
