Time-Series Forecasting is the process of predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. This involves using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze past trends and patterns in the data and make predictions about future behavior. Common forecasting methods include ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), exponential smoothing, and machine learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. Time-series forecasting is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, and supply chain management, to make informed decisions and plan for future events. Time series data is unique because it has a temporal component, meaning the order of observations matters. Techniques for time series prediction range from simple visualization tools to advanced machine learning models like ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. These models leverage past values, trends, seasonality, and other features to make accurate predictions.
