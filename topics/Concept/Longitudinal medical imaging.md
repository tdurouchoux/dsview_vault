Longitudinal medical imaging involves the analysis of medical images taken over a period of time to track the progression or regression of medical conditions. This type of imaging is crucial for monitoring chronic diseases, treatment efficacy, and overall patient health. MedGemma 1.5 4B improves support for longitudinal medical imaging, particularly in chest X-ray time series review, providing more accurate and detailed insights over time.
