Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is an algorithm used primarily in solving extensive-form games, particularly those with imperfect information like poker. CFR aims to minimize regret, which is a measure of lost opportunities, by iteratively updating strategies to improve performance over time. It is widely used in AI research for game-playing agents.
