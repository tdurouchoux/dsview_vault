Task-Oriented Prompts are a type of prompt designed to focus on a specific task or function within a conversational AI system. Unlike general prompts that aim to handle a wide range of user queries, task-oriented prompts are tailored to perform a particular function, such as collecting information, routing conversations, or providing specific responses. These prompts are typically shorter and more concise, allowing for more accurate and predictable outputs. Task-oriented prompts are particularly useful in complex conversational flows where specific tasks need to be performed efficiently and accurately. They can be used in conjunction with other prompts, such as mega-prompts, to create a more flexible and adaptable conversational AI system.
