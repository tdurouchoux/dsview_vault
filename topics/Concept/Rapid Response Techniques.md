Rapid response techniques are methods designed to quickly identify and defend against novel jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs) after observing only a few examples. These techniques focus on monitoring for new jailbreaks and rapidly adapting defenses to block whole classes of attacks. They are an alternative to traditional approaches that aim for perfect adversarial robustness.
