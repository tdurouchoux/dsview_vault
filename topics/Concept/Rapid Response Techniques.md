Rapid response techniques are methods designed to quickly adapt and defend against novel jailbreaking attacks on large language models (LLMs). These techniques involve monitoring for new jailbreak attempts, generating additional examples through proliferation, and fine-tuning defensive models to block these attacks. The goal is to reduce the success rate of jailbreaks by rapidly updating the model's defenses based on observed attack patterns.
