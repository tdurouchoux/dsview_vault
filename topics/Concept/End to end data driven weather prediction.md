End-to-end data-driven weather prediction refers to the approach of using machine learning models to replace the entire traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) pipeline. This approach involves training a single model to ingest observational data and produce forecasts directly, without relying on intermediate numerical models. The goal is to improve the speed, accuracy, and flexibility of weather forecasting. This method leverages advances in deep learning and neural networks to handle complex atmospheric data and produce accurate predictions.
