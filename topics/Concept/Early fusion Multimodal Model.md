An early-fusion multimodal model integrates different types of data (e.g., audio and text) at the initial stages of processing. This approach allows the model to leverage the combined information from multiple modalities to improve performance and understanding. Early-fusion models are particularly useful in tasks that require simultaneous processing of diverse data types.
