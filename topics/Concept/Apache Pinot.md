Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore designed for low-latency analytics on large-scale datasets. It is particularly optimized for handling large-scale, real-time data ingestion and supporting complex, ad-hoc queries with low latency. Pinot is often used in scenarios requiring real-time analytics, such as user behavior analysis, financial data monitoring, and other applications where timely insights are crucial.
