Neo AI refers to a cutting-edge approach in artificial intelligence that focuses on creating autonomous AI systems capable of self-improvement and adaptation without human intervention. This concept often involves advanced machine learning techniques, autonomous agents, and self-learning algorithms. Neo AI systems are designed to operate independently, making decisions and learning from their environments to enhance their performance over time. This approach aims to develop AI that can evolve and improve its capabilities, potentially leading to more sophisticated and versatile applications in various fields.
