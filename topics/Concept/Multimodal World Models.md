Multimodal World Models are advanced AI systems that integrate and process information from multiple data modalities, such as text, images, and other sensory inputs, to create comprehensive simulations of real-world environments. These models are designed to fuse diverse data streams, enabling nuanced simulations and predictions. In the context of drug discovery, multimodal world models can analyze large datasets spanning various scales and modalities to identify biological targets for drug development. This approach combines large datasets with transformer-based architectures to simulate complex biological systems, facilitating advancements in fields like cancer immunotherapy.
