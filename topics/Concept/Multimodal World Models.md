Multimodal World Models are advanced AI systems that integrate and process data from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and other sensory inputs, to create comprehensive simulations or representations of complex systems. These models are designed to fuse different data streams to enable nuanced simulations and predictions. In the context of drug discovery, multimodal world models can be used to simulate patient biology and identify potential biological targets for drug development, leveraging large datasets and transformer-based architectures to enhance understanding and prediction capabilities.
