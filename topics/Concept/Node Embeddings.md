Node embeddings are vector representations of nodes in a graph, capturing the structural and attribute information of the nodes. These embeddings are typically learned using techniques like matrix factorization, random walks, or deep learning. Node embeddings are useful for various downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph visualization.
