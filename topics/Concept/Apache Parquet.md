Apache Parquet is a popular, free, open-source, column-oriented data storage format. It is designed to be efficiently queried directly, allowing users to read individual columns instead of always having to read all of them. Parquet is known for its efficient compression and is widely used as a data interchange format in data lake solutions like Delta Lake and Iceberg. Parquet files are widely used in data science for their performance and efficiency and support efficient compression and selective reading/writing of columns, making them suitable for storing text embeddings along with their metadata.
