Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to quantify the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome) to make predictions or understand the impact of the predictors on the outcome. Types include linear regression, multiple regression, polynomial regression, and regularized regression techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.
