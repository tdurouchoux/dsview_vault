A convex quadratic model is a mathematical model used to approximate the behavior of optimization problems. It is defined by a quadratic function that is convex, meaning it has a single minimum point. This model is simple enough to be analyzed in closed form yet rich enough to capture essential dynamics of more complex problems. It is often used to study the behavior of optimization algorithms like gradient descent and momentum.
