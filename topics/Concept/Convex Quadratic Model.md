The convex quadratic model is a simplified yet rich model used to understand the dynamics of optimization algorithms like gradient descent and momentum. It involves optimizing a quadratic function, which allows for closed-form solutions and easy analysis. This model captures key features of pathological curvature and provides insights into the behavior of optimization algorithms in more complex scenarios.
