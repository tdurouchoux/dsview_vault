A concept from quantitative finance used to model and quantify trade-offs in multi-objective optimization problems. It represents the optimal balance between two conflicting goals, such as risk and reward in investment portfolios, or system quality and speed of development in software projects. The efficient frontier helps in understanding the trade-offs and making informed decisions about resource allocation and prioritization.
