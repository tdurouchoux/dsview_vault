Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an architectural component used in the DeepSeek-V3 model to enhance efficiency in both inference and training processes. It is designed to optimize attention mechanisms, which are critical for the performance of large language models. MLA helps in reducing computational overhead and improving the model's ability to handle large-scale data efficiently.
