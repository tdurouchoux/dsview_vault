Claude.md is a configuration file used in the Claude Code ecosystem to provide context and guidelines for the AI agent. It serves as a 'constitution' for the agent, detailing how the repository works, including guardrails, usage examples, and documentation pointers. This file helps the agent understand the repository's structure and constraints, ensuring it operates within the defined parameters and best practices. Claude.md is a structured guide created to provide coding agents with detailed instructions and best practices for using specific libraries, such as LangGraph. It includes information on common project structures, coding standards, and pitfalls to avoid. Claude.md is designed to be concise and focused, ensuring that agents have access to the most important information without being overwhelmed by excessive details.
