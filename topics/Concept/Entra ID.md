Entra ID, previously known as Azure Active Directory, is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It provides a way to control access to applications and resources based on users' identities. Entra ID supports single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and conditional access policies, enhancing security and simplifying identity management. In the context of the PostgreSQL extension for VS Code, Entra ID integration allows for centralized identity management, streamlined authentication, and enhanced security for PostgreSQL database connections, ensuring robust protection and seamless access for developers.
