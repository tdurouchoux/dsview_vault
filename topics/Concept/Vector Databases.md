Vector databases, also known as vectorstores, are specialized databases designed to store and manage vector embeddings, which are numerical representations of data points in a high-dimensional space. These databases are particularly useful in machine learning and AI applications, where they enable efficient similarity search and retrieval of data based on vector representations. Vector databases are commonly used in tasks such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and generative AI applications.
