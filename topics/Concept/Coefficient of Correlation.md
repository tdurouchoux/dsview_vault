The coefficient of correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related (linearly correlated). It is a standardized measure of association between two variables, giving a value between -1 and 1 inclusive, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and -1 is total negative linear correlation.
