Modular RAG is an advanced paradigm in the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that offers greater flexibility and diversity in the overall process. Unlike the traditional Naive RAG framework, which consists of indexing, retrieval, and generation modules, Modular RAG integrates various methods to expand functional modules. This includes incorporating a search module in similarity retrieval, applying a fine-tuning approach in the retriever, and introducing specific problems that lead to restructured RAG modules. Modular RAG allows for either a serialized pipeline or an end-to-end training approach across multiple modules, making it the mainstream in the RAG domain. It enables the integration of new modules such as search, memory, extra generation, task adaptable, alignment, and validation, providing a more adaptable and effective framework for enhancing the capabilities of large language models.
