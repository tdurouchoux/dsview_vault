Modular RAG represents a more flexible and adaptable approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Unlike the traditional Naive RAG framework, Modular RAG allows for the integration of various methods and modules to enhance specific functionalities. This paradigm includes the addition of new modules such as search modules, memory modules, extra generation modules, task adaptable modules, alignment modules, and validation modules. Modular RAG can be organized either as a serialized pipeline or through end-to-end training across multiple modules, providing greater flexibility and adaptability in the RAG process. This approach aims to address specific deficiencies in Naive RAG and improve the overall performance and effectiveness of the RAG system.
