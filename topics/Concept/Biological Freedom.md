Biological freedom refers to the idea that individuals should have the autonomy and control over their own biological processes and characteristics. This concept encompasses the ability to make choices about one's physical appearance, reproductive capabilities, and overall biological functioning. Advances in AI-driven biology are expected to expand the scope of biological freedom, allowing people to choose and modify aspects of their biology to better align with their personal preferences and desires. This includes the potential to control weight, physical appearance, reproduction, and other biological processes, thereby empowering individuals to live their lives in a manner that best suits their personal goals and values.
