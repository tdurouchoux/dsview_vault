Multi-agent orchestration refers to the coordination and management of multiple autonomous agents working together to achieve complex tasks. This involves designing systems where agents can communicate, collaborate, and hand off tasks to each other, often using lightweight and scalable frameworks such as CrewAI. Multi-agent systems are particularly useful in scenarios requiring diverse capabilities and dynamic interactions, allowing for more flexible and adaptable solutions compared to single-agent systems.
