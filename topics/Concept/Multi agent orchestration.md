Multi-agent orchestration refers to the coordination and management of multiple autonomous agents working together to achieve complex tasks. This involves designing systems where agents can communicate, collaborate, and hand off tasks to each other, often using lightweight and scalable frameworks. The goal is to create efficient, controllable, and testable networks of agents that can handle a variety of tasks without a steep learning curve.
