Latent variables are variables in a statistical model that are not directly observed but are rather inferred from other variables that are observed or measured. They are used to describe relationships between observed variables in terms of underlying latent structure. Latent variables are commonly used in factor analysis, latent class analysis, and other modeling techniques.
