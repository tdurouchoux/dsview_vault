Harmonic Reasoning is a training approach for models that involves creating a 'harmonic' interplay between asynchronous, continuous-time streams of sensing and acting tokens. This allows models to scale to very large sizes without depending on System1-System2 architectures or inference-time guidance, enabling seamless thinking and acting in real-world physical systems.
