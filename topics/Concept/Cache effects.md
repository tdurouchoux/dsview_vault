Cache effects refer to the performance impacts that result from how data is accessed and stored in the CPU cache. These effects can significantly influence the speed of data processing, especially when dealing with large datasets that may not fit entirely in the cache. Understanding cache effects is essential for optimizing performance in both low-level and high-level programming languages.
