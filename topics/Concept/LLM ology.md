The study and analysis of large language models (LLMs), focusing on their behavior, capabilities, and limitations. LLM-ology involves researching how these models process and generate language, their potential biases, and their impact on various applications. This field is characterized by the examination of LLMs as complex systems, often without full access to their training data or internal mechanisms, leading to both advancements and challenges in understanding their functionality.
