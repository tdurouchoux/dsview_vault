Semantic Clustering and Code Analytics involve grouping code based on functionality or structure using unsupervised learning techniques. This process helps in analyzing repository composition, identifying emergent architecture patterns, and feeding into automated documentation and categorization systems. By clustering code semantically, developers can gain insights into the organization and structure of their codebase, leading to better maintenance and understanding.
