The AgentQ framework is a specialized tool for building and training AI agents that can perform tasks autonomously on the web. It combines several advanced techniques, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), self-critique mechanisms, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to enable agents to learn and improve through self-correction. AgentQ is designed to handle the complexity of web interactions, helping agents navigate web pages, complete tasks, and adapt to new challenges effectively.
