Policy-based methods in reinforcement learning involve directly learning a policy that maps states to actions. These methods optimize the policy to maximize the expected reward. Techniques like REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Actor-Critic methods are examples of policy-based approaches.
