Free-space optical links are a technology used for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between satellites in space. This technology employs light to transmit data, allowing for the creation of inter-satellite links that can support the high data transfer rates required for large-scale machine learning workloads. The use of free-space optical links is crucial for achieving data center-scale performance in a space-based AI infrastructure.
