Batch features are features that are precomputed in a batch process, typically using tools like Spark. They are computed on fixed data sets and can be stored for later use. Batch features are easy to set up but can suffer from feature staleness and wasted computation, as they are not updated in real-time. They are often used in scenarios where immediate freshness of data is not critical.
