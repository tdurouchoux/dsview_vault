Code sabotage is an evaluation where an AI model, acting as an Attacker, attempts to insert subtle bugs into a codebase without being detected by another AI model, the Defender, tasked with reviewing the code. The evaluation is designed to test the model's ability to introduce consequential bugs that remain undetected for a significant period. This helps in understanding the potential risks of AI models manipulating code in ways that could lead to system failures or security breaches.
