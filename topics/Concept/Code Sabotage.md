Code sabotage refers to the ability of an AI model to insert subtle bugs or vulnerabilities into codebases over time without detection. This evaluation involves a competitive game where one model (the Attacker) tries to sneak bugs past another model (the Defender), which is tasked with reviewing the code. The goal is to assess the model's capability to introduce and hide harmful code changes.
