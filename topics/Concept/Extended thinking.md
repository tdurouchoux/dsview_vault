Extended thinking refers to the capability of advanced language models to engage in complex, multi-step reasoning and reflection. This involves guiding the model to think through problems, reflect on intermediate results, and plan subsequent actions. This mode is available in models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and is particularly useful for tasks requiring detailed analysis, iterative problem-solving, and strategic planning, enhancing the model's ability to handle intricate and multi-faceted tasks. Although this mode provides higher quality answers, it comes at the cost of increased processing time and tokens.
