GraphSAGE is a graph-based machine learning algorithm that supports supervised and unsupervised representation learning, node classification/regression, and link prediction for homogeneous networks. It uses sampling and aggregation techniques to generate node embeddings that can generalize to unseen nodes. GraphSAGE supports multiple aggregation methods, including mean, maxpool, meanpool, and attentional aggregators. This algorithm is particularly useful for large-scale graphs where traditional methods may not scale efficiently.
