LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Extraction is a method for extracting low-rank approximations of fine-tuned models. This technique allows for the efficient transfer of knowledge from fine-tuned models to other models, enabling the creation of models with specific capabilities without the need for extensive fine-tuning.
