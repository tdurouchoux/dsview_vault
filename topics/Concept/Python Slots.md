Python Slots are a way to optimize the memory usage and access speed of class instances by defining a fixed set of attributes. By using the `__slots__` declaration, you can specify the attributes that an instance of a class can have, which reduces the overhead of dynamic attribute creation and lookup. Slots are particularly useful for classes with a large number of instances or performance-critical applications.
