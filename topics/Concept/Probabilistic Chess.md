Probabilistic Chess is a variant of the traditional chess game that incorporates probabilities into the movement of pieces. Each move has a success probability, determined by the destination square, and is resolved through a dice roll. This introduces an element of chance, making the game more dynamic and unpredictable. The objective remains capturing the opponent's king, but the probabilistic nature means that even a checkmate does not guarantee a win, as the capture of the king is not certain. This variant aims to add excitement and strategy by requiring players to think probabilistically and adapt their strategies based on the success probabilities of moves.
