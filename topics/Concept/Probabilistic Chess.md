Probabilistic Chess is a variant of the traditional chess game that incorporates probabilities into each move. Each square on the board has a success probability, and a dice roll determines whether a move is successful. This adds an element of unpredictability and strategy, as players must consider the probabilities of successful moves and the potential outcomes of each decision. The game aims to capture the opponent's king, but due to the probabilistic nature, capturing the king is not guaranteed even in a checkmate situation. This dynamic makes the game more exciting and unpredictable.
