Semantic operators are declarative transformations over datasets, parameterized by natural language expressions. They extend the relational model to include unstructured data, allowing for operations like mapping, filtering, extracting, aggregating, and joining based on natural language predicates. These operators are designed to be implemented and optimized in various ways, providing a high-level logic for AI-based pipelines while leaving optimizations to the query engine.
