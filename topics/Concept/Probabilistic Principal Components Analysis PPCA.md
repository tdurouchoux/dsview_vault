Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that leverages a latent variable framework to recover the directions of maximal variance in the data. It models the data probabilistically, assuming that the observed data is generated from latent variables with added noise. PPCA can handle missing values and is closely related to classical PCA, differing mainly in its probabilistic formulation.
