Probabilistic Principal Components Analysis (PPCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that leverages a latent variable framework to recover the directions of maximal variance in the data. It models the data in terms of distinct signal and noise components, assuming that the noise follows an Isotropic Gaussian distribution. PPCA can be used for data visualization, feature extraction, and handling incomplete data, offering functionality that classical PCA does not.
