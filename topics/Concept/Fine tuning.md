Fine-tuning is a technique used to adapt a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to a specific task or domain. This involves further training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset, in order to improve its performance on that task. Fine-tuning can be an effective way to improve the accuracy and reliability of the model's outputs, but it can also be time-consuming and expensive. As such, it is important to carefully consider the costs and benefits of fine-tuning before undertaking this process.
