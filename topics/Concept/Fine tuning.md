Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to perform specific tasks or improve performance on particular datasets. It involves further training the model on a smaller, task-specific dataset to fine-tune its parameters. Fine-tuning can enhance the model's accuracy and relevance for specialized applications but requires significant computational resources and data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a process where a pre-trained language model is further trained on a specific dataset with labeled examples. This helps the model to adapt to specific tasks, learn to structure answers, and reactivate a subset of knowledge learned during pre-training. It is crucial for turning base models into helpful assistants. This process leverages the general language understanding of the pre-trained model and fine-tunes it to recognize patterns and features relevant to the classification task at hand.
