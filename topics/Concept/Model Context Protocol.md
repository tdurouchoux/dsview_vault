The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed to facilitate the integration and interaction of AI models with external data and tools. It provides a standardized way to manage and utilize model contexts, enabling developers to build applications that leverage these contexts effectively. MCP aims to streamline the process of using AI models in various applications by providing a framework for context management, data handling, and tool integration. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol designed to facilitate interactions between AI applications and external data sources, tools, infrastructure, and data APIs. Developed by Anthropic, MCP aims to enable seamless integration of large language models (LLMs) with various resources, supporting user workflows by allowing two-way communication, tool discovery, and a rich set of primitives for servers and clients. It is intended to create a massive ecosystem similar to other widely adopted protocols like REST, USB-C, or TCP/IP, reducing the need for individual one-to-one integrations and improving interoperability. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard and framework that facilitates the integration of AI models with external data sources, tools and a growing ecosystem of third-party tools. It acts as a bridge, enabling AI models to interact with and utilize a wide range of external resources to enhance their capabilities and context-awareness. It provides a simple client implementation for enhancing LLMs with capabilities such as retrieval, tools, and memory. The protocol aims to facilitate the development of agentic systems by providing a standardized way to integrate and manage these augmentations.
