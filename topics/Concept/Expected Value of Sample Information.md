The expected value of sample information (EVSI) is a concept in decision theory that quantifies the benefit of obtaining additional information before making a decision. It measures the expected improvement in decision outcomes that results from reducing uncertainty through additional sampling or experimentation. EVSI helps in determining whether collecting more data is worthwhile and how much it is worth investing in gathering additional information.
