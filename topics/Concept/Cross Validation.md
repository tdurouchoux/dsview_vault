Cross-validation is a statistical method used to evaluate machine learning models by dividing the data into different subsets for training and validation. It helps in assessing the model's performance and generalizability, as well as in tuning hyperparameters and mitigating overfitting. Effective cross-validation strategies are crucial for reliable model evaluation and selection in time series forecasting.
