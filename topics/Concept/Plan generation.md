Plan generation is the process of creating a sequence of actions or steps to achieve a specific goal. In the context of AI agents, plan generation involves using AI models to propose a plan based on the available tools and the task at hand. This process can be guided by prompt engineering, where the model is provided with examples and instructions to generate a coherent and effective plan. Plan generation is a critical component of AI agents, enabling them to autonomously plan and execute tasks.
