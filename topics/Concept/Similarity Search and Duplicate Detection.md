Similarity Search and Duplicate Detection involve identifying near-duplicate or functionally similar code segments within a codebase. This is achieved using embeddings that capture the semantic and structural properties of code. The technique supports various use cases, such as identifying reusable code to avoid duplication, detecting copy-paste reuse to enforce licensing policies, and improving code maintainability by grouping similar code segments.
