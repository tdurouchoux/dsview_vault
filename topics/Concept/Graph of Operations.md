Graph of Operations (GoO) is a structured approach within the Graph of Thoughts framework that models problems as a series of interconnected operations. Each operation represents a step or a thought process that contributes to solving the problem. The GoO is executed by a Large Language Model (LLM), which navigates through the graph to perform the necessary operations, making it a powerful tool for complex problem-solving.
