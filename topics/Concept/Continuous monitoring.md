Continuous monitoring in MLOps implies the periodic assessment of data, model, code, infrastructure resources, and model serving performance (e.g., prediction accuracy) to detect potential errors or changes that influence the product quality. Continuous monitoring helps ensure that the ML system operates smoothly and that any issues are detected and addressed promptly.
