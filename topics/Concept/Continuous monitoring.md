Continuous monitoring in MLOps implies the periodic assessment of data, models, code, infrastructure resources, and model serving performance to detect potential errors or changes that influence the product quality. It involves monitoring prediction accuracy, data quality, model drift, and infrastructure performance. Continuous monitoring ensures that issues are detected and addressed promptly, maintaining the reliability and performance of ML systems. Tools like Prometheus with Grafana, ELK stack, and TensorBoard are commonly used for continuous monitoring.
