Prompt optimization involves improving the prompts used to interact with language models to achieve better and more accurate responses. This can be done by refining the language, structure, and context of the prompts based on training data and evaluation metrics. DSPy provides tools and modules to automate and optimize this process, making it easier to get the desired outputs from language models.
