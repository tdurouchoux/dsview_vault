InfiniBand is a high-speed networking technology used to connect multiple nodes in a GPU cluster, enabling fast data transfer and communication between nodes. InfiniBand provides low-latency, high-bandwidth connections, making it suitable for large-scale machine learning and data science applications. In GPU clusters, InfiniBand is used to create a scale-out network that connects multiple nodes, allowing for efficient collective operations and data sharing. The topology and bandwidth of InfiniBand networks vary by system configuration, with higher-end models like the NVIDIA H100 and B200 offering more advanced InfiniBand capabilities.
