Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their features. In the context of topic modeling, clustering is used to group similar documents together based on their embeddings. The goal is to identify coherent topics in the corpus. Common algorithms for clustering include HDBSCAN and k-Means Clustering. k-Means Clustering is a method used for vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This method is popular for cluster analysis in data mining and is commonly used in machine learning and pattern recognition. The algorithm works by assigning each data point to one of the k clusters based on the nearest cluster mean, recalculating the new means, and repeating the process until convergence. The goal is to minimize the variance within each cluster.
