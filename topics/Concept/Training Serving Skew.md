A difference in performance between the training phase and the serving phase of a machine learning system. This skew can be caused by discrepancies in data handling, changes in data between training and serving, or feedback loops between the model and the algorithm. It is important to monitor and minimize training-serving skew to ensure consistent model performance in production environments.
