Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method for regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization. In the context of Apache Polaris, RBAC is used to centrally configure access for service principals to catalogs, namespaces, and tables. It involves two role types: principal roles granted to service principals and catalog roles configured with specific privileges on Polaris catalog resources and granted to principal roles.
