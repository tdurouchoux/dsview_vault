Entity Resolution is the process of identifying, matching, and merging records that correspond to the same real-world entity from different data sources. It is crucial for data cleaning and integration, especially when dealing with noisy or inconsistent data. This process helps in disambiguating entities and improving data quality for various data science tasks.
