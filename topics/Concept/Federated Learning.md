Federated Learning is a machine learning paradigm that trains a model across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging their data. This approach aims to address privacy concerns by keeping data localized, allowing entities to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and security. It is particularly useful in scenarios where data cannot be centralized due to privacy, regulatory, or proprietary reasons.
