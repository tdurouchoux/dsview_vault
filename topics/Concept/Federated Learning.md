Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm where a central server coordinates with multiple decentralized devices to collaboratively train a model without exchanging their raw data. Each device trains a model locally on its own data and only shares model updates with the central server. The server aggregates these updates to improve the global model, ensuring that raw data remains private and localized. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where data privacy is a concern, such as in healthcare, finance, or any domain where data cannot be centralized due to regulatory or proprietary reasons. Federated learning enables the development of robust models while respecting data privacy and ownership.
