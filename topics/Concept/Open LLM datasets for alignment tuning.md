Open LLM datasets for alignment-tuning are datasets used to align the behavior of large language models with human values and intentions. These datasets often include human feedback and interactions to help models generate more appropriate and useful responses. An example is the OpenAssistant Conversations Dataset, which contains 161,000 samples of human-AI conversations.
