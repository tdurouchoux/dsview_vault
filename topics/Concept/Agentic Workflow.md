Agentic workflow refers to the design and execution of workflows that leverage AI agents to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These workflows are designed to mimic human-like decision-making processes, utilizing AI agents that can make decisions, take actions, and interact with various tools and data sources to achieve specific goals. This approach is particularly useful in automating complex processes that require adaptive and intelligent decision-making.
