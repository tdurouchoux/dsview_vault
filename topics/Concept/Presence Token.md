The presence token is a component in the SAM 3 model that decouples the recognition and localization steps in object detection. It predicts whether a target concept is present in an image or frame, allowing the model to focus on localization without being distracted by global context. This improves detection accuracy by separating the tasks of recognizing and localizing objects.
