A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a mathematical concept representing a collection of nodes and edges with no directed cycles. In the context of Airflow, a DAG is a model that encapsulates everything needed to execute a workflow, including tasks, schedules, and dependencies. It defines the order and conditions under which tasks execute and includes additional operational details such as callbacks and parameters.
