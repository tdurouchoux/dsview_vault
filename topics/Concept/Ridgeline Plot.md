A ridgeline plot is a type of data visualization that displays the distribution of data across multiple categories or groups using overlapping density plots. Each curve in a ridgeline plot represents a different category, and the height and color of the curves can be used to show additional dimensions of the data. Ridgeline plots are particularly useful for visualizing changes in distribution over time or across different groups, as they allow viewers to easily compare the shapes and patterns of the distributions. In the context of this article, ridgeline plots are used to show how different cohorts of women varied in terms of the ages at which they had children and the number of children they had.
