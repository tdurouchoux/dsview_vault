A waterfall chart is a type of visual representation used to illustrate the cumulative effect of sequentially introduced positive or negative values. In the context of machine learning and explainable AI, waterfall charts are used to deconstruct a model's prediction into the contributions of individual features. Each feature's contribution is shown as a step in the chart, starting from a base value (often the average prediction) and ending with the final prediction. This visualization helps to understand how each feature influences the prediction, making it easier to interpret the model's behavior and identify key drivers of the prediction.
