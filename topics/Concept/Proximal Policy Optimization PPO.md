Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm that is used for fine-tuning language models in the context of RLHF. PPO is a trust region optimization algorithm that uses constraints on the gradient to ensure the update step does not destabilize the learning process. It is a relatively mature algorithm that has been adapted for use in distributed training for RLHF.
