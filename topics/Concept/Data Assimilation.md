Data assimilation is the process of combining observational data with numerical models to estimate the state of a system, such as the atmosphere. It involves integrating new observations with the output of a forecasting model to improve the accuracy of predictions. Data assimilation systems are used in numerical weather prediction to generate initial conditions for forecasts and to update the model state as new data becomes available. Traditional data assimilation systems use recursive methods, such as the Kalman filter, to incorporate observations into the model state.
