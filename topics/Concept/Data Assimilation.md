Data assimilation is the process of combining observational data with numerical models to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. It involves integrating new observations into an existing forecast model to update the model's state. Data assimilation is crucial for generating accurate initial conditions for weather predictions and is a key component in traditional numerical weather prediction systems.
