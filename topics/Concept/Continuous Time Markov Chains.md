Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) are stochastic processes that model systems where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In CTMCs, time is continuous, and the process is characterized by a rate matrix that describes the transition rates between states. The waiting times between transitions are exponentially distributed, preserving the memoryless property.
