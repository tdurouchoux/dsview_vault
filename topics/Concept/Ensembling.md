Ensembling is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance and robustness of the final prediction. Common ensembling methods include simple averaging (blending), weighted averaging, stacking, and bagging. Ensembling can help reduce variance, improve generalization, and mitigate the risk of overfitting. However, it also increases the complexity of the model and can make it harder to interpret and maintain in production environments.
