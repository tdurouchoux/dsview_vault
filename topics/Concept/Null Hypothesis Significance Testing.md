Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is a methodological procedure used to test hypotheses by examining whether observed data differs significantly from what is expected under a null hypothesis. It involves calculating a p-value to determine if the observed effect is statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to have occurred by random chance. NHST helps researchers make ordinal claims about differences between conditions, distinguishing signals from noise in empirical data. It is a safeguard against confirmation bias, ensuring that claims are made with a controlled error rate.
