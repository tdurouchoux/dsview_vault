dbt Core, or data build tool Core, is an open-source data transformation framework that enables data analysts and engineers to transform raw data in their data warehouses using SQL. It allows users to write modular SQL queries to clean, transform, and aggregate data, creating a layer of structured, analytics-ready tables. dbt Core promotes best practices in data modeling, such as modularity, reusability, and version control, through its project structure and dependencies. It integrates with various data warehouses and BI tools, making it a popular choice for data teams looking to streamline their data transformation processes and improve collaboration.
