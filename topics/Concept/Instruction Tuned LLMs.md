Instruction-Tuned LLMs are large language models that have been specifically fine-tuned on datasets containing instructions and desired responses. This tuning process helps the models to better understand and follow instructions, making them more effective for tasks that require specific actions or responses. These models are often used in applications where precise and context-aware responses are crucial.
