The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a benchmark designed to test machine intelligence through puzzles that require core knowledge such as elementary physics, objectness, counting, and basic geometry. It is designed to be resistant to memorization, requiring machines to reason through novel tasks without relying on pre-existing knowledge. The ARC benchmark is used to evaluate the ability of AI models to perform abstract reasoning and problem-solving, making it a significant tool in the assessment of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
