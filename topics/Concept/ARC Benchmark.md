The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a benchmark designed to test machine intelligence through puzzles that require core knowledge such as elementary physics, objectness, and counting. It is designed to be resistant to memorization, featuring novel puzzles that machines must solve from scratch without relying on pre-existing knowledge or patterns. The ARC benchmark is used to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs), and to distinguish between skill and true intelligence.
