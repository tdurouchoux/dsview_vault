Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a representation of semantic relations between entities. They have proven to be particularly relevant for natural language processing (NLP), experiencing a rapid spread and wide adoption within recent years. KGs are used to represent knowledge in a structured format, making it easier to understand and process by machines. They are composed of nodes (entities) and edges (relationships) and are used in various applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and question answering systems. Knowledge graphs are graphical representations of knowledge, where entities are represented as nodes and relationships between entities are represented as edges. They are used to organize and visualize complex information, making it easier to understand and navigate. Knowledge graphs are particularly useful in fields like artificial intelligence, data science, and information management, as well as for reasoning and completing missing information, organizing, retrieving, and understanding information, making them valuable for various applications in artificial intelligence, data science, search engines, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
