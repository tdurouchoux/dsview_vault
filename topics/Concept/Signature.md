In the context of DSPy, a signature is a way of defining the desired inputs and outputs for a task that an LLM (Large Language Model) should perform. Signatures can be simple strings or more complex class definitions that specify the types and formats of the inputs and outputs. They serve as a blueprint for generating prompts and structuring the interactions with the language model.
