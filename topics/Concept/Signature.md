In the context of DSPy, a signature is a way of expressing what you want an LLM to do by defining the desired input and outputs. Signatures can be simple strings or more complex class definitions that specify the types and structure of the inputs and outputs. They are used to generate prompts that guide the LLM in performing the desired task.
