Extended thinking with tool use is a feature in the Claude 4 models that allows them to use tools during extended thinking processes. This capability enables the models to alternate between reasoning and tool use, such as web search, to improve the quality and accuracy of their responses. It is particularly useful for complex tasks that require multiple steps and tools.
