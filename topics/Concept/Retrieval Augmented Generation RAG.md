Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique used to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by providing them with additional context during inference. This context is typically retrieved from an external database or knowledge source. The goal is to improve the factuality and verifiability of the LLM's responses, especially when adapting to new domains. RAG systems can face challenges such as confidently predicting incorrect answers, being distracted by unrelated information, and failing to properly extract answers from long text snippets. A technique that enhances the performance of language models by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge graph or database to augment the generated responses. This approach improves the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models. It involves retrieving relevant information from a database or knowledge base and using it to augment the generation process, improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated text. RAG systems are particularly useful for handling complex, multimodal documents and providing detailed, context-aware outputs. Semantic search retrieves information based on the meaning of the query rather than just keyword matching. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines semantic search with generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating text.
