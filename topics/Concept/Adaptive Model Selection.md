Adaptive Model Selection is a strategy that involves dynamically choosing the most appropriate language model or version based on the specific requirements of a task. This approach allows for optimizing performance, cost, and reliability by selecting models that are best suited for different scenarios, such as handling high-memory contexts or addressing specific user needs.
