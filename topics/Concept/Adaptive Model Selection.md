Adaptive Model Selection is a strategy used in AI systems to dynamically choose the most appropriate model or set of models to use based on the current context or requirements of the task. This approach involves monitoring the performance and cost of different models and selecting the most suitable one for a given task. Adaptive Model Selection can be used to optimize the performance and cost of AI systems, particularly in scenarios where the requirements of the task may change over time or where different models may be more suitable for different types of tasks. This strategy can help to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of AI systems, making them more adaptable to a wide range of user needs and scenarios.
