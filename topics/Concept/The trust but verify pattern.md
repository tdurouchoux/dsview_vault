The trust but verify pattern is a cautious approach to using AI-assisted coding tools. It involves using the AI for initial code generation but manually reviewing all critical paths, automating testing of edge cases, and conducting regular security audits. This pattern emphasizes the importance of human oversight and verification to ensure the reliability, security, and robustness of the code. By trusting the AI to handle routine tasks while verifying its output, developers can leverage the benefits of AI-assisted coding while minimizing the risks.
