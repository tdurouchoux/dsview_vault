Confidence intervals (CIs) are a range of values that are believed to encompass the true value of a population parameter with a certain level of confidence, typically 95%. They provide a measure of the uncertainty around a point estimate, such as a mean or effect size. CIs help researchers understand the precision of their estimates and the range within which the true value is likely to fall. Unlike p-values, CIs do not depend on a null hypothesis and provide a more nuanced understanding of the data.
