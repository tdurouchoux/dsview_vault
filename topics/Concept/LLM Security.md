LLM security encompasses the measures and techniques used to protect large language models (LLMs) from various vulnerabilities and threats. This includes addressing prompt hacking, where techniques like prompt injection and jailbreaking can manipulate model outputs, and backdoors, which involve poisoning training data to alter model behavior. Defensive measures include red teaming, where models are tested against potential vulnerabilities, and using frameworks like langfuse to monitor model performance in production. Ensuring the security of LLMs is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of applications that rely on these models. Red-teaming in the context of AI and NLP involves systematically challenging and testing models to identify vulnerabilities, biases, and potential failures. This process helps in improving the robustness and safety of AI systems by simulating adversarial attacks and stress-testing the models under various conditions. Red-teaming is essential for ensuring that AI systems are reliable and secure.
