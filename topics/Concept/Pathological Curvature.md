Pathological curvature refers to regions in the loss landscape where the function is not properly scaled, leading to slow convergence or getting stuck in optimization algorithms. These regions are often characterized by narrow valleys, trenches, or ravines, causing gradient descent to take small, timid steps or oscillate between valleys. Momentum helps mitigate these issues by accelerating convergence and smoothing out updates.
