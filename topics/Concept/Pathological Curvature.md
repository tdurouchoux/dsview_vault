Pathological curvature refers to regions in the loss landscape where the function is not properly scaled, leading to inefficient convergence in gradient descent. These regions are often characterized by narrow valleys, trenches, or ravines, causing the optimizer to oscillate or make very small steps. Understanding and mitigating pathological curvature is crucial for improving the efficiency of optimization algorithms.
