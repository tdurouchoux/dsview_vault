Data Sharing involves the exchange of data between organizations or entities under specific conditions and agreements. It aims to facilitate collaboration and data-driven decision-making by allowing controlled access to data that may be sensitive or proprietary. Data Sharing often involves the use of secure platforms, smart contracts, and data governance frameworks to ensure data security, privacy, and compliance with regulations.
