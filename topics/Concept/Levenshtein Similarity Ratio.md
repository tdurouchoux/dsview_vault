A measure of the similarity between two sequences, defined as the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. It is used to quantify the grapheme proximity of messages in the 3âˆ†-space duplicate methodology. The Levenshtein Similarity Ratio is derived from the Levenshtein Distance and the total length of both sequences. It provides a measure of similarity between the two strings, with a higher ratio indicating greater similarity. Variants of the Levenshtein Similarity Ratio include the Partial Ratio, Token-sort Ratio, and Token-set Ratio, which are used to compare sub-strings, sorted tokens, and token sets, respectively.
