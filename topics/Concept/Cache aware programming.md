Cache-aware programming is a technique where developers optimize their code to take advantage of the CPU's cache hierarchy. This involves organizing data structures and access patterns in a way that maximizes the use of the cache, reducing the need for slower main memory access. This is particularly important in languages like C++ and Rust, where fine-grained control over memory layout is possible.
