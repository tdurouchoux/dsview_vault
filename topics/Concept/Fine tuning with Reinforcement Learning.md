Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning involves using a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to optimize the parameters of a language model based on the reward signal provided by the reward model. This stage aims to improve the language model's performance in generating text that is preferred by humans, while also incorporating a penalty term to prevent the model from deviating too much from the initial pretrained model.
