Multimodal models are designed to process and integrate multiple types of input data, such as text, images, and audio, into a unified embedding space. These models enable powerful applications like text-to-image generation, image captioning, and more. Examples of multimodal models include CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and LLaVA. By leveraging different modalities, these models can perform complex tasks that require understanding and generating content across various data types, making them highly versatile and useful in numerous applications.
