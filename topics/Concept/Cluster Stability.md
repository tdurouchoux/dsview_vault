Cluster stability refers to the consistency of the clusters identified by a clustering algorithm when applied to different subsets of the data or to resampled data. A cluster is considered stable if it is consistently identified across different runs of the algorithm or different samples of the data. Cluster stability can be assessed using methods like bootstrap resampling, where the clustering algorithm is applied to multiple resamples of the data, and the frequency of each cluster is recorded.
