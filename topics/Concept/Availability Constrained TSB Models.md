Availability-Constrained TSB (Teunter-Syntetos-Babai) Models are used for forecasting intermittent time series, which are common in retail where products exhibit sporadic demand patterns. These models distinguish between true zero demand and zeros caused by product unavailability, leading to more accurate forecasts for products with limited availability histories. This approach is particularly valuable for inventory planning and allocation.
