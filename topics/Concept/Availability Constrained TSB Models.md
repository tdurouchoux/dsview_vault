Availability-Constrained TSB (Teunter-Syntetos-Babai) Models are used for intermittent time series forecasting, particularly in retail. These models account for product availability constraints, distinguishing between true zero demand and zeros caused by product unavailability. This approach leads to more accurate forecasts for products with sporadic demand patterns, providing reliable demand estimates for inventory planning and allocation.
