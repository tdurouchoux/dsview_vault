An independent initiative by IBM focused on agent-to-agent communication. ACP aims to standardize robust agent interactions, diverging from MCP during its alpha phase to address specific requirements around agent communication. It is designed to be a standalone standard optimized for agent interactions, distinguishing itself from MCP's context-sharing focus.
