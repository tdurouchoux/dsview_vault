The Agent Context Protocol (ACP) is an independent initiative started by IBM, focusing on agent-to-agent communication. It is designed to standardize communication between AI agents, addressing the emerging requirements around agent interactions. ACP plans to diverge from MCP during its alpha phase to establish a standalone standard optimized for robust agent interactions, making it a potential alternative or complement to MCP in the future.
