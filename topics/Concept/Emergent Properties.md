Emergent properties in the context of large language models refer to capabilities that emerge after a certain scale or quality of data is reached, which were not explicitly trained for. These properties can include improved understanding, better use of external libraries, and enhanced performance on tasks not featured in the finetuning dataset. The concept is important for understanding the potential and limitations of large language models.
