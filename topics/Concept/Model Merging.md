Model merging is a technique that combines the strengths of different pretrained models by operating directly in their weight space. This process allows for the creation of versatile models that maintain the inference cost of a single model while achieving comparable or superior performance. Model merging can transfer capabilities between models, find optimal trade-offs between different model behaviors, and create new capabilities through creative model combinations.
