Model merging is a technique where the layers of different AI models are combined to improve their performance. For example, the weights of the layers of two models can be averaged to create a new model with better performance. Model merging allows to leverage the strengths of several models to create a more robust and performant model. Techniques like SLERP, DARE, and TIES are used to merge models.
