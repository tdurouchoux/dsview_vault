Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly. It allows running Python code directly in the browser, enabling web-based data science and computational tasks without the need for a server backend. Pyodide combines the Python runtime with scientific libraries compiled to WebAssembly, making it possible to execute Python in a web environment.
