Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser that uses WebAssembly to run Python code in a web environment. It allows for the execution of Python scripts and libraries directly in the browser, enabling the use of Python for web-based applications. Pyodide includes a package manager called micropip for installing Python packages and provides access to a virtual file system, making it a powerful tool for running Python in a serverless context.
