Instruction Generation involves creating detailed and complex instructions that can be used to train and evaluate LLMs. These instructions are designed to guide the model in performing specific tasks, understanding context, and generating accurate and relevant responses. High-quality instruction generation is crucial for improving the model's ability to follow complex commands, understand nuanced instructions, and perform a wide range of tasks effectively.
