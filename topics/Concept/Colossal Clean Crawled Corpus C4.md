The Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4) is a large dataset of cleaned and filtered text data scraped from the web. It is used for pre-training language models to learn general-purpose knowledge before fine-tuning on specific tasks. C4 is designed to be diverse and representative of natural language, making it a valuable resource for training robust and generalizable models.
