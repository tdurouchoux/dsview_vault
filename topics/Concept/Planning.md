Planning in the context of AI agents involves the process of generating a sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal. This process includes understanding the task, considering different options, and selecting the most promising path. Effective planning requires the agent to understand the task's constraints and the potential outcomes of each action. Planning can be decoupled from execution to avoid fruitless steps and validated using heuristics or AI judges to ensure its effectiveness.
