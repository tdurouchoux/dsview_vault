BugBench is a curated benchmark of real code diffs with human-annotated bugs. It is used for offline evaluation of Bugbot's performance, allowing the team to assess the impact of changes and experiments on bug detection and resolution. BugBench provides a standardized set of examples to test and improve Bugbot's capabilities.
