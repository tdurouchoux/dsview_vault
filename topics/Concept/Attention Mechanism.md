The attention mechanism is a crucial component in transformers, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing each part of the output sequence. It enables the model to weigh the importance of each input element with respect to the current element being processed, facilitating better understanding and generation of contextually relevant outputs. The mechanism involves calculating attention scores through dot products between queries and keys, which are then used to compute a weighted sum of values, updating the embeddings to reflect contextual information. Self-attention, in particular, enables the model to dynamically weigh the importance of different input elements, capturing long-range dependencies and context.
