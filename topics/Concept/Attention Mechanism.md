The attention mechanism is a fundamental concept in the Transformer model, allowing it to focus on different parts of the input sequence dynamically. It enables the model to weigh the importance of various input elements when producing each output element, thereby capturing long-range dependencies and improving the model's ability to handle sequential data. The attention mechanism in the Transformer is implemented through scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention, which allow the model to focus on different representation subspaces at different positions.
