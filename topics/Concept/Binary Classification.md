Binary classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning where the goal is to classify instances into one of two possible classes. In the context of language models, binary classification is used to distinguish between valid and invalid outputs. The text discusses the Is-It-Valid (IIV) binary classification problem, which involves learning to identify valid generations using labeled examples. The analysis shows that the generative error rate in language models is related to the misclassification rate in binary classification, highlighting the statistical nature of errors in language models.
