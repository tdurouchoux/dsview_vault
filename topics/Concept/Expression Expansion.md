Expression expansion refers to the process of applying a transformation or function to multiple columns or expressions in a DataFrame simultaneously. In Polars, this concept allows for efficient and concise code by leveraging the library's ability to expand and apply operations across selected columns or expressions, often using selectors and generators to handle multiple combinations.
