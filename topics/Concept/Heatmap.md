A heatmap is a data visualization technique that uses color to represent values in a matrix or table. It is particularly useful for visualizing large datasets and identifying patterns, correlations, or outliers. In the provided source text, the importance of reordering rows and columns in a heatmap is emphasized to make the visualization more effective. Additionally, checking for outliers and considering the data range at each factor level are highlighted as crucial steps in creating meaningful heatmaps.
