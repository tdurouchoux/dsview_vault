A heatmap is a data visualization technique that uses color to represent data values in a matrix. The intensity of the color in each cell of the matrix represents the magnitude of the value. Heatmaps are particularly useful for visualizing complex data sets, such as those involving multiple dimensions or large data points. In the source text, the importance of reordering rows and columns and checking for outliers in heatmaps is emphasized to ensure effective data communication.
