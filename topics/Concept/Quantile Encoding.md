Quantile encoding is a technique used to transform categorical features into numerical values based on quantiles. It uses quantiles instead of means for aggregation, making it more robust to outliers. This method is particularly useful for handling high cardinality categorical features in regression problems. Quantile encoding involves hyperparameters that need tuning, such as the quantile value and a regularization parameter M. The formula for quantile encoding is given by QE_i = (q(category_i) * n_i + q(whole) * M) / (n_i + M), where QE_i is the encoding value for the i’th category, q(category_i) is the quantile of the values within the i’th category, q(whole) is the quantile of the whole dataset, n_i is the number of observations in the i’th category, and M is the regularization hyperparameter.
