Code attribution refers to the process of tracing and identifying the origin of code snippets within a dataset. In the context of StarCoder, a novel attribution tracing tool was developed to help identify and attribute code snippets to their original contributors. This tool is part of the efforts to ensure ethical and responsible use of code data in training language models.
