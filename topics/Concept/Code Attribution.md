Code attribution involves tracing and identifying the origin of code snippets generated by models like StarCoder. A novel attribution tracing tool was developed to find generated code in the dataset, helping to ensure transparency and proper credit to original contributors. This tool is part of the efforts towards a safe and responsible open model release.
