The Leaderboard Illusion refers to the distorted playing field in AI model evaluations, particularly in platforms like Chatbot Arena. This illusion arises from undisclosed private testing practices, selective score reporting, and data access asymmetries, which benefit a handful of providers and skew the rankings. The illusion highlights the need for transparency and fairness in AI model evaluations to ensure reliable and trustworthy rankings.
