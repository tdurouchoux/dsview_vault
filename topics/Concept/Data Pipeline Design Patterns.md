Data Pipeline Design Patterns refer to the various approaches and methodologies used to design and manage data pipelines. These patterns address different aspects of data flow, including extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as handling sources and sinks. They aim to ensure that data pipelines are robust, efficient, and maintainable. Common patterns include extraction patterns (time-ranged, full snapshot, lookback, streaming), behavioral patterns (idempotent, self-healing), and structural patterns (multi-hop pipelines, conditional/dynamic pipelines, disconnected data pipelines).
