A lakehouse is a data management architecture that combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. It allows for the storage of data in open formats like Parquet while providing database-like features such as schema enforcement, transactional support, and efficient querying capabilities. Lakehouses aim to offer a unified solution for both batch and real-time data processing, making them versatile for various data management tasks.
