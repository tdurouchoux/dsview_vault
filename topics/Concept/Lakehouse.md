A lakehouse is a data management architecture that combines the best features of data lakes and data warehouses. It aims to provide the scalability and cost-efficiency of data lakes with the data management and transactional capabilities of data warehouses. Lakehouses typically use open data formats like Parquet and leverage metadata management systems to handle data changes and ensure data consistency.
