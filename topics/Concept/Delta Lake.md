Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads. It provides reliability features like schema enforcement, data versioning, and audit history, making it easier to manage large-scale data lakes. Delta Lake uses a transaction log to keep track of changes, ensuring data consistency and enabling efficient updates and deletes. It is designed to work with existing data processing tools and storage systems.
