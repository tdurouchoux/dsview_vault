A universal semantic layer extends the concept of a traditional semantic layer by aiming to provide a consistent, organization-wide definition of business metrics and entities that can be accessed and used by any analytical tool or application. This layer is designed to be universally accessible, meaning it can be queried and utilized by various tools and platforms without the need for each tool to have its own separate semantic definitions. The goal is to create a single source of truth for business logic that can be leveraged across different analytical applications, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy. It serves as an intermediary between data storage and data visualization, providing a unified view of metrics and dimensions. It allows for the declarative definition of metrics and dimensions, enabling consistent and reusable definitions across different tools and platforms. This layer helps bridge the gap between data storage, analysis, and visualization in a unified, declarative framework.
