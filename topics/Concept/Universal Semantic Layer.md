A universal semantic layer extends the concept of a traditional semantic layer by aiming to provide a consistent, accessible, and flexible encoding of business logic and data relationships that can be utilized by any analytical application or tool within an organization. It seeks to support a wide range of analytical tasks, from simple reporting to complex, exploratory data analysis, and to facilitate the integration and interoperability of diverse data tools and platforms. The goal is to create a single source of truth for business logic and data definitions that can be leveraged across the entire data ecosystem, promoting consistency, efficiency, and collaboration.
