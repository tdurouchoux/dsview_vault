Latent spaces refer to the high-dimensional spaces into which data points are embedded, often through techniques like dimensionality reduction. These spaces capture the underlying structure of the data, making it easier to visualize and explore complex datasets. Latent Scope uses these spaces to provide insights and perspectives on unstructured data.
