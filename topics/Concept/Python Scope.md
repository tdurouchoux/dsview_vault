Python scope refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables within different parts of a program. Python has several levels of scope, including built-in scope, module scope, enclosing scope, and local scope. Variables defined in one scope may or may not be accessible in other scopes, and understanding scope is crucial for writing correct and efficient Python code.
