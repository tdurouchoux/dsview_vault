Python scope refers to the context in which a variable is defined and accessed. It determines the visibility and lifetime of variables within a program. Python has several levels of scope, including global scope, local scope, and enclosing scope. Understanding scope is crucial for managing variable access and avoiding naming conflicts in Python programs.
