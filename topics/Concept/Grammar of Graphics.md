The Grammar of Graphics is a theoretical framework that breaks down statistical graphics into semantic components, allowing users to describe the relationships between data and visual elements rather than specifying how to draw the chart. This approach enables the creation of more maintainable, flexible, and robust data presentations, focusing on what to communicate rather than the intricacies of how to draw it. Tools like ggplot2 in R and Vega-Light implement this grammar.
