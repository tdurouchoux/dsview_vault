Chart anatomy refers to the structural components and elements that make up a data visualization. Understanding chart anatomy involves recognizing the various parts of a chart, such as axes, labels, legends, and the data representation itself. Each component plays a crucial role in how data is presented and interpreted. For instance, axes define the scale and range of the data, while labels and legends provide context and clarity. By dissecting a chart into its fundamental parts, one can better analyze and critique its effectiveness in conveying information.
