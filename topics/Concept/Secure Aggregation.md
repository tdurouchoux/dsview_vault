Secure Aggregation is a cryptographic technique used in federated learning to combine local model updates from multiple devices without revealing any individual contribution. This method ensures that the central server only sees the aggregated result, enhancing privacy by preventing the identification of individual data contributions. It typically involves using shared random numbers to mask local models before aggregation.
