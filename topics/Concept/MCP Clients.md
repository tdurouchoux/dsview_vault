MCP Clients are programs or applications that interact with MCP servers. They can call tools, access resources, and use prompts defined on the server. FastMCP provides client libraries that support various transports and handle advanced patterns like server-initiated LLM sampling requests. Clients can connect to multiple servers through a unified interface.
