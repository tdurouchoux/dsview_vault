Reference-free metrics, also known as context-based metrics, evaluate the quality of generated text without relying on a reference or ground truth text. These metrics assess the text based on its own qualities, such as fluency, coherence, relevance, and factual consistency. Reference-free metrics are particularly useful in scenarios where creating a reference text is difficult or impractical. Examples of reference-free metrics include quality-based metrics, entailment-based metrics, and factuality-based metrics. These metrics often leverage advanced techniques such as natural language inference and semantic role labeling to evaluate the text.
