Reference-free metrics are evaluation methods that assess the quality of generated text without relying on a reference or ground truth text. These metrics are particularly useful in scenarios where creating a reference text is difficult or impractical. Reference-free metrics evaluate the generated text based on various qualities such as fluency, coherence, relevance, and factual consistency. They can be based on different approaches, including quality-based metrics, entailment-based metrics, and factuality-based metrics. Reference-free metrics are designed to be scalable and adaptable to a wide range of tasks, making them valuable for evaluating the performance of language models and other text generation systems.
