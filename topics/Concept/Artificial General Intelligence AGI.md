Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to hypothetical AI systems that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to or beyond human capabilities. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, and understanding natural language. Achieving AGI, or human-level intelligence in machines, is a major goal in the field of artificial intelligence, involving advanced algorithms, neural networks, and cognitive architectures that can mimic or even surpass human cognitive abilities. Key challenges include addressing brittle reasoning, drifting goals, shallow memory, and poor calibration under uncertainty. Achieving AGI requires advancements in model design, evaluation metrics, and deployment strategies, as well as the integration of user feedback loops to create systems that can reason, remember, and recover effectively.
