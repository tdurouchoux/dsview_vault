Code agents are a type of agent where the LLM writes actions in code rather than in JSON-like snippets. This approach leverages the expressiveness and composability of code, making it easier to manage complex tasks and interactions with external tools. Code agents are considered more effective and flexible compared to traditional tool-calling agents.
