Urban Network Visualization refers to the process of creating visual representations of urban networks, such as road networks, to analyze and understand spatial data. This involves using tools like OSMnx, NetworkX, and GeoPandas to download, manipulate, and visualize geospatial data, which is crucial for urban planning and transportation-related applications.
