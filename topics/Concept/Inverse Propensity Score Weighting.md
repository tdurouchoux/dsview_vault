Inverse Propensity Score Weighting (IPSW) is a statistical technique used to adjust for bias in observational studies. It involves weighting each unit in the sample by the inverse of its propensity score, which helps to balance the covariates between treated and untreated groups. This method is particularly useful for estimating causal effects in non-experimental settings.
