Autonomous web agents are AI systems designed to perform tasks on websites without human intervention. They can interact with web pages by clicking buttons, filling out forms, scraping data, and navigating through pages. These agents use a combination of visual information (like screenshots) and structural data (like HTML or DOM) to make decisions and take actions. They are built to automate repetitive or complex tasks online, such as signing up for newsletters, placing orders, or gathering information.
