Autonomous web agents are AI systems designed to interact with websites to perform tasks such as data scraping, form filling, and content summarization. These agents use both visual information (like screenshots) and structural data (like HTML or DOM) to navigate and make decisions on web pages. They are built to handle complex interactions and optimize their performance through advanced decision-making strategies.
