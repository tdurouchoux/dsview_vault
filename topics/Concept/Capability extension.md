Capability extension refers to the process of enhancing an agent's abilities by integrating tools that address its inherent limitations. For example, providing an agent with access to a calculator can improve its mathematical capabilities, while giving it access to a code interpreter can enable it to execute and analyze code. Capability extension allows agents to perform tasks more efficiently and accurately, leveraging external tools to compensate for their limitations.
