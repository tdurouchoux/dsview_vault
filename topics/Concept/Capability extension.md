Capability extension refers to the use of tools that address the inherent limitations of AI models. These tools can boost a model's performance by providing functionalities that the model is not inherently good at, such as mathematical calculations, translations, and code execution. Examples include calculators, calendars, timezone converters, unit converters, and code interpreters.
