Self-consistency is a technique used to improve the accuracy of text-to-SQL outputs. It involves generating multiple queries for the same user question using different prompting techniques or model variants, and then selecting the best query from all the candidates. This technique increases the likelihood that the final SQL query will be accurate and match what the user is looking for.
