Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a type of neural network designed to operate directly on graph-structured data. GCNs use convolutional operations to aggregate information from neighboring nodes, enabling the network to learn from the graph's structure and relationships. This approach is particularly useful for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph-based recommendations.
