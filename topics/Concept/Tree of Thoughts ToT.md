A prompting scheme that models the LLM reasoning process with a tree. This facilitates using different paths of thoughts and offers novel capabilities such as backtracking from non-promising outcomes. The Graph of Thoughts framework aims to go beyond the rigid tree structure of ToT to enable more flexible and powerful reasoning.
