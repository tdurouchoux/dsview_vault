Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is a prompting scheme that models the LLM reasoning process with a tree. This facilitates using different paths of thoughts, offering novel capabilities such as backtracking from non-promising outcomes. ToT enhances CoT by allowing the exploration of multiple reasoning paths, making it more flexible and powerful in solving complex problems.
