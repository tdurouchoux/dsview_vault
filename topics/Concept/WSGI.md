WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification for a simple and universal interface between web servers and Python web applications. It maps the server-side requests to the web applications written in Python, making it easier to develop web applications that are both portable and scalable. WSGI is widely used in Python web development to ensure compatibility and interoperability between different web servers and applications.
