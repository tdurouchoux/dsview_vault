Protocols in Python, also known as Structural Subtyping, allow developers to define interfaces that classes can follow without requiring inheritance. Using the Protocol class from the typing module, developers can specify method signatures that classes must implement. This feature supports duck typing, enabling type checking for classes that adhere to the specified structure, enhancing code flexibility and maintainability.
