type: Concept

Protocols in Python are a way to define structural subtyping, allowing you to specify the expected structure or behavior of an object without requiring it to inherit from a specific class. This is particularly useful for implementing duck typing, where the type checker verifies that an object implements certain methods or properties, regardless of its actual type. Protocols help enforce type safety and improve code clarity by making the expected interface explicit.
