The data analysis workflow is a complex and iterative process that involves multiple stages, including task formulation, data collection, exploratory analysis, visualization, validation, and communication of insights. Each stage requires a distinct set of skills and tools, and the process often involves iterating back and forth among these stages. The workflow can be enhanced by AI-powered tools that assist in various tasks, such as data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation, making the process more efficient and accessible to non-experts.
