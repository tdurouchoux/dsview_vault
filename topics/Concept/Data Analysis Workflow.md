The data analysis workflow is a structured process that involves multiple stages, including task formulation, data collection, exploratory analysis, data transformation, visualization, validation, and report generation. Each stage requires a distinct set of skills and tools. The workflow is often iterative, with analysts moving back and forth between stages to refine their analysis. Generative AI can streamline this process by automating repetitive tasks, providing suggestions, and enhancing user interactions through intuitive interfaces and personalized recommendations.
