Covariate Balancing Propensity Score (CBPS) is a method used to balance covariates between treatment and control groups in observational studies. It extends the traditional propensity score approach by directly incorporating covariate balancing into the estimation process, which can improve the efficiency and accuracy of the propensity score estimates. CBPS is particularly useful for reducing bias in causal inference.
