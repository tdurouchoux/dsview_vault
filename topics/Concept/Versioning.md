Versioning in the context of MLOps involves tracking and managing different versions of data, models, and code. It ensures that changes can be traced and rolled back if necessary, which is crucial for reproducibility, compliance, and auditing. Versioning allows teams to keep track of the evolution of their ML systems, enabling better collaboration and reducing the risk of errors. Tools like Git for code versioning and MLflow for model versioning are commonly used to implement versioning in ML workflows.
