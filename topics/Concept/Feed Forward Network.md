A feed-forward network (FFN) is a fully connected network that is applied to each position in the sequence independently and identically. In the context of Transformers, the FFN consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. It is used to introduce non-linearity and complexity to the model, allowing it to learn more intricate patterns and transformations.
