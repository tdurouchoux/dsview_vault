Context Managers in Python provide a way to allocate and release resources precisely when needed, using the with statement. They define __enter__ and __exit__ methods to handle setup and teardown operations, ensuring that resources are properly managed. The contextlib module simplifies the creation of context managers using decorators, making it easier to write clean and maintainable code for resource management. Context managers are typically used with the 'with' statement and are implemented using classes that define the methods '__enter__' and '__exit__'. They are commonly used for file handling, database connections, and other operations that require resource management.
