Context Managers in Python are a way to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to. They are used with the `with` statement and define the runtime context to be established when executing a `with` statement. Context managers handle setup and teardown actions, ensuring that resources are properly managed and errors are handled gracefully. They are particularly useful for file handling, database connections, and other resource-intensive operations.
