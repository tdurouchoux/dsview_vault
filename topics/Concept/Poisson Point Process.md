A Poisson point process is a type of point process where events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate (Î»). It is characterized by the Poisson distribution, which describes the number of events in a given interval, and the exponential distribution, which describes the waiting times between events. Poisson point processes are used to model various phenomena, such as the arrival of customers in a queue, the occurrence of earthquakes, or the distribution of stars in the sky.
