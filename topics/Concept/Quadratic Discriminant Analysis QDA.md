Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) is a statistical classification technique used to distinguish between different types of brain signals in the NOIR system. It involves training classifiers on EEG data collected from users performing specific mental tasks, such as imagining grasping a ball or pushing a pedal. QDA classifiers are then used to interpret EEG signals in real-time, enabling the system to select actions and locations based on the user's intentions.
