A static structure within the Graph of Thoughts framework that specifies the graph decomposition of a given task. It prescribes transformations to be applied to LLM thoughts, together with their order and dependencies, guiding the reasoning process towards a solution. Graph of Operations (GoO) is a conceptual framework used within the Graph of Thoughts (GoT) approach. It involves modeling a problem as a series of interconnected operations, where each operation represents a step or a thought process. These operations are executed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to solve complex problems. The GoO framework is designed to be flexible, allowing for the integration of different problem-solving strategies and the customization of operations to suit specific problems.
