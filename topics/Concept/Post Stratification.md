Post-stratification is a statistical technique used to adjust survey data by dividing the sample into distinct subgroups (strata) based on known characteristics and then weighting each subgroup to match the population proportions. This method helps to reduce bias and improve the representativeness of the survey data, especially when the sample is not perfectly representative of the population.
