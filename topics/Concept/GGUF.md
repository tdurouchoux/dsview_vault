GGUF (Guanine-Guanine-Uracil-Furan) is a format used for quantized models, particularly large language models. It allows for efficient storage and execution of these models by reducing their size through quantization techniques. GGUF models can be easily integrated and run using applications like Ollama, providing flexibility in choosing different quantization schemes and templates for interaction.
