GGUF (Guaranteed Gradient Update Format) is a format used for quantized models, particularly large language models. It allows for efficient storage and execution of models by reducing their size and optimizing their performance. GGUF files can be used with various applications like Ollama, GPT4All, and llama.cpp.
