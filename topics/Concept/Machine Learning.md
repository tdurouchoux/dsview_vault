Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make decisions or predictions based on data. It involves training models on data to improve their performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed. Tabular machine learning is a type of machine learning that involves working with data in tabular form, where each row represents an instance and each column represents a feature. This approach is commonly used for structured data.
