Timely dataflow is a low-latency cyclic dataflow computational model. It is designed to be a distributed data-parallel compute engine that can scale programs from a single thread on a laptop to distributed execution across a cluster of computers. The main goals are expressive power and high performance, making it potentially more expressive and faster than other dataflow systems.
