Timely dataflow is a low-latency cyclic dataflow computational model introduced in the paper 'Naiad: a timely dataflow system'. It is designed to scale programs from a single thread to distributed execution across a cluster of computers, focusing on expressive power and high performance. It supports multiple levels of abstraction, from low-level manual dataflow assembly to higher-level declarative abstractions.
