Human-in-the-Loop Data Analysis (HILDA) is an approach to data management that emphasizes end-to-end systems and fosters data-centric communities. It involves a collaborative approach to data management, where humans and AI models work together to generate, validate, and iterate on data artifacts. HILDA supports the iterative nature of dashboard development and other BI tasks, enabling continuous refinement and maintaining consistency while reducing technical overhead.
