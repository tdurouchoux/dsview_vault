Human-in-the-Loop Data Analysis (HILDA) is an approach to data management that emphasizes the collaboration between humans and AI models in the data analysis process. In the context of GenBI, HILDA involves a workflow where humans and AI models brainstorm, generate, and iterate on BI artifacts, such as dashboards, metrics, and data models. This approach ensures that the generated artifacts are accurate, contextually relevant, and aligned with business requirements, enhancing the overall data analytics experience.
