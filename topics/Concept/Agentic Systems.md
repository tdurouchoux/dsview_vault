Agentic systems refer to architectures that leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks. These systems can be categorized into workflows, where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths, and agents, where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. Agentic systems are used to accomplish complex tasks by utilizing various tools and maintaining control over the task accomplishment process.
