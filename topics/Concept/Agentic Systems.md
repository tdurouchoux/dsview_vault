Agentic systems refer to architectures that leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform tasks. These systems can be categorized into workflows, which follow predefined code paths, and agents, which dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage. Agentic systems are designed to enhance task performance by using LLMs to orchestrate various tools and processes, either through fixed sequences or adaptive, autonomous decision-making.
