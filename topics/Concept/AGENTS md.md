AGENTS.md is a simple, universal standard developed by OpenAI that provides AI coding agents with a consistent source of project-specific guidance. This markdown-based convention enhances the predictability of agent behavior across different repositories and toolchains, making it easier for developers to build and deploy reliable AI agents. AGENTS.md has been adopted by numerous open-source projects and agent frameworks.
