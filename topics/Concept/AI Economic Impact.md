The effects of artificial intelligence on economic systems, including job displacement, economic growth, and wealth concentration. The economic impact of AI can lead to significant changes in labor markets, with AI systems potentially replacing human workers in various sectors. This can result in job displacement and economic inequality, requiring interventions such as progressive taxation, philanthropy, and government policies to mitigate negative effects and ensure a just distribution of economic benefits.
