Open Responses is an open-source specification for multi-provider, interoperable LLM interfaces inspired by the OpenAI API. It defines a shared request/response model, streaming semantics, and tool invocation patterns to ensure clients and providers can exchange structured inputs and outputs in a consistent format. The specification includes an agentic loop for model interactions, items as the atomic unit of context, semantic streaming events for predictable client interactions, and extensibility for provider-specific tools and item types without altering the core schema.
