A set of best practices and guidelines for machine learning engineering, compiled by Martin Zinkevich. It covers various phases of machine learning projects, from initial setup to advanced optimization, and provides practical advice on metrics, feature engineering, monitoring, and model evaluation. The rules are designed to help teams build and deploy effective machine learning systems by focusing on infrastructure, objectives, and iterative improvements.
