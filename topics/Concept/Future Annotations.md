Future Annotations in Python refer to the use of the __future__ import statement to enable or modify the behavior of certain features in a forward-compatible way. This is particularly useful for type annotations, allowing for cleaner forward references and reducing runtime overhead. It's a way to prepare your code for future Python versions while maintaining compatibility with the current one.
