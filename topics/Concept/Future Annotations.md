Future Annotations in Python refer to the use of the __future__ import statement to enable upcoming Python features in current code. This includes features like postponed evaluation of annotations, which helps manage forward references and circular dependencies in type annotations. Future annotations allow developers to use new syntax and features before they are fully implemented, ensuring smoother transitions and better code compatibility.
