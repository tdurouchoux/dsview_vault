Parallelization is a workflow where LLMs work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This method manifests in two key variations: sectioning, where a task is broken into independent subtasks run in parallel, and voting, where the same task is run multiple times to get diverse outputs. It is effective for tasks that can be parallelized for speed or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results.
