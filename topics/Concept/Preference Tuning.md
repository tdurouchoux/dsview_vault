Preference tuning is a method used to refine language models by adjusting their behavior based on human preferences. This involves fine-tuning the model on data that reflects user preferences, ensuring that the model generates outputs that are more aligned with what users find desirable or appropriate. Preference tuning helps improve the relevance and quality of the model's responses.
