Test-time compute scaling involves adjusting the computational resources allocated during the inference phase of large language models (LLMs) to improve performance. This technique can include multiple calls to the model, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), or the use of specialized models like Process Reward Models (PRMs). By scaling the compute budget during test time, models can achieve better performance on complex reasoning tasks, making this an important area of research and application in the field of LLMs.
