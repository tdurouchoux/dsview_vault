Classifier guidance is a technique used to improve the alignment of generated images with specific classes or text prompts. It involves using the gradients of a classifier to guide the diffusion process, ensuring that the generated images are more closely aligned with the desired class or text prompt. This technique helps in producing higher-quality images that better match the input conditions.
