Classifier guidance is a technique used to improve the alignment of generated images with text prompts by incorporating class information directly into the diffusion process. It involves training a classifier on noised images and using the classifier's gradients to guide the sampling process towards the desired class. This technique helps in generating images that are more aligned with the given text prompt, enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated images.
