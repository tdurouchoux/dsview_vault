N-gram based metrics are a type of reference-based metric used to evaluate the quality of text generated by a model. These metrics measure the similarity between the generated text and a reference text by comparing the frequency of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n items from a given sequence of text) in both texts. Common n-gram based metrics include BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). These metrics are widely used in tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.
