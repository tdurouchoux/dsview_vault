Data deduplication is the process of identifying and removing duplicate data from a dataset. In the context of the FineWeb dataset, deduplication is performed using MinHash with each crawl deduplicated individually. This process helps to improve the quality and efficiency of the dataset by ensuring that redundant information is removed.
