The fair use doctrine is a legal principle that allows the use of copyrighted material without the copyright holder's consent under certain circumstances, such as for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. In the context of AI, it is often invoked by companies to justify the use of copyrighted works for training generative AI models.
