Late Interaction Models are a type of information retrieval model that preserve token-level information by interacting with query and document representations at a later stage in the retrieval process. Unlike traditional models that compress documents into single vectors, late interaction models like ColBERT maintain detailed information, leading to better performance on complex tasks.
