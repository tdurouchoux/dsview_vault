Open LLMs (Large Language Models) are models that are available for commercial use under licenses such as Apache 2.0, MIT, or OpenRAIL-M. These models are designed to be used, modified, and distributed freely, making them accessible for various applications and research purposes. They are often released with accompanying datasets and training codes to facilitate further development and customization.
