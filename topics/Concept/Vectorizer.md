A conceptual abstraction that treats vector embeddings as derived data, similar to database indexes. This approach ensures that embeddings are automatically synchronized with their source data, reducing the need for manual updates and minimizing the risk of stale or inconsistent data. The vectorizer abstraction simplifies data management by handling the complexities of embedding generation and synchronization within the database system.
