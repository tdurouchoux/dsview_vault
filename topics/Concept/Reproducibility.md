Reproducibility in the context of MLOps refers to the ability to reproduce an ML experiment and obtain the exact same results. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability and validity of ML models. Reproducibility is closely linked to versioning of data, model, and code, as well as thorough documentation and tracking of ML metadata.
