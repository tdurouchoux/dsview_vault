Censored likelihoods are used in forecasting models to handle data where observations are only partially known, such as when values above or below a certain threshold are unobserved or replaced with the threshold value. This is common in retail where sales data only captures observed demand when products are in stock. Bayesian models with censored likelihoods can provide more accurate demand forecasts by modeling the underlying demand distribution even during periods with stockouts or capacity constraints.
