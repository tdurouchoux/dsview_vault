Censored likelihoods are used in demand forecasting to handle situations where observations are only partially known. Censoring occurs when values above or below a certain threshold are unobserved or replaced with the threshold value itself. Bayesian models with censored likelihoods can provide more accurate demand forecasts by modeling the underlying demand distribution even during periods with stockouts or capacity constraints, effectively reconstructing what the true demand would have been.
