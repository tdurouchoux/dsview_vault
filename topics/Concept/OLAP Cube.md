An OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) cube is a multidimensional data structure that is widely used in data warehousing and business intelligence. It allows for fast and efficient data analysis by pre-aggregating data along multiple dimensions, enabling users to perform complex calculations and trend analysis. OLAP cubes are particularly useful for GenBI, as they provide the necessary speed and efficiency to handle complex analytical queries in real time, ensuring that GenBI systems can maintain interactive response times even when processing large datasets.
