Real-time features are computed at the time of prediction, providing fresh data for models to use. They are easy to set up but can be challenging to scale, as their computation latency adds directly to user-facing latency. Real-time features are computed upon receiving prediction requests, making them suitable for use cases where immediate data freshness is crucial.
