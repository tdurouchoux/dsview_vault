Real-time features are computed at the time of prediction, ensuring freshness but can be harder to scale and optimize for latency. They are computed upon receiving prediction requests, which can affect user-facing latency, especially with traffic growth and fluctuation. Real-time features are easy to set up but may become infeasible for complex features due to computation time.
