Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that every training example is paired with an output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs so that the model can predict the output for new, unseen inputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks.
