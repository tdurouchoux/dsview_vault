Task-based workflows in MCP provide a new abstraction for tracking the work performed by an MCP server. This feature allows clients to query the status of tasks, retrieve results, and manage multi-step operations. Tasks can have various states, including working, input_required, completed, failed, and cancelled, enabling effective management of complex operations.
