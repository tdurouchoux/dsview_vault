FLIP is a method that aligns ID-based recommendation models with pretrained language models by jointly learning from masked tabular and language data. It involves three stages: modality transformation, modality alignment pretraining, and adaptive finetuning. FLIP aims to reconstruct masked features from one modality using information from another, ensuring tight cross-modal alignment and improving the performance of recommendation systems.
