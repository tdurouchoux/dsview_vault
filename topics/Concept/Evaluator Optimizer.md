The evaluator-optimizer workflow involves one LLM call generating a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. This method is effective when there are clear evaluation criteria and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. It is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through to produce a polished document.
