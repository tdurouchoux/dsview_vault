The evaluator-optimizer workflow is a pattern where one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop. This workflow is effective when clear evaluation criteria exist and iterative refinement provides measurable value. It is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through to produce a polished document.
