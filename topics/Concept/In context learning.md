In-context-learning is a technique used to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) by providing them with relevant context. This context can include schema annotations, examples of similar SQL queries, business rules, or recent queries run against the same datasets. By organizing this data into prompts and passing it to the model, the model can generate more accurate and contextually relevant SQL queries.
