Orchestration Layers in Agentic AI systems are responsible for coordinating the lifecycle of subordinate agents, managing dependencies, assigning roles, and resolving conflicts. These layers include task managers, evaluators, or moderators that oversee the interactions between multiple agents. Orchestration Layers ensure that agents operate coherently and efficiently, enabling complex, high-level objectives to be achieved through collaborative efforts. They are essential for managing the coordination and communication between multiple agents in dynamic and complex environments.
