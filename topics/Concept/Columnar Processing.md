Columnar processing is a data processing technique where data is stored and processed column by column rather than row by row. This approach is particularly efficient for analytical queries and data manipulation tasks, as it allows for better data compression, improved cache utilization, and more efficient execution of aggregations and filtering operations. Columnar processing is a key feature of modern data processing systems, including Polars, and is crucial for achieving high performance in data-intensive applications.
