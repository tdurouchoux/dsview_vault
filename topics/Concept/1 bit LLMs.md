1-bit LLMs (Large Language Models) refer to a class of language models that use 1-bit precision for their weights, significantly reducing the model size and computational requirements compared to traditional models. These models aim to maintain performance while being more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational power. The concept of 1-bit LLMs is part of a broader trend towards developing more efficient and scalable AI models, particularly for edge devices and local inference.
