MetaP is a new training technique developed by Meta AI for setting critical model hyper-parameters such as per-layer learning rates and initialization scales. This technique ensures that the chosen hyper-parameters transfer well across different model configurations, including variations in batch size, model width, depth, and training tokens, leading to more efficient and effective model training.
