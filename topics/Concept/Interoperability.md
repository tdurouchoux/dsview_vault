Interoperability refers to the ability of different systems, tools, or libraries to work together seamlessly. In the context of the Transformers library, interoperability is a key focus to ensure that models can be easily integrated and used with various tools and frameworks. This includes compatibility with different inference engines, training tools, and deployment platforms, making it easier for developers to implement and fine-tune models for various applications.
