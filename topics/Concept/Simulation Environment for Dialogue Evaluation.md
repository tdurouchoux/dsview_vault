The simulation environment for dialogue evaluation is a comprehensive framework developed to enable rapid iteration and robust automated assessment of the AMIE system. This environment generates realistic patient scenarios, simulates turn-by-turn multimodal dialogues between AMIE and a patient agent, and evaluates these simulated dialogues against predefined clinical criteria. The simulation environment uses datasets like PTB-XL and SCIN, augmented with plausible clinical context using Gemini models with web search, to create realistic and diverse scenarios for evaluation.
