Time-Series Anomaly Detection refers to the process of identifying unusual patterns or outliers in time series data. This involves analyzing sequential data points collected over time to detect deviations from expected behavior, which can indicate anomalies. Various methods and algorithms are employed to perform this task, ranging from statistical techniques to machine learning models. The goal is to identify anomalies that may signify significant events, errors, or changes in the underlying system generating the data.
