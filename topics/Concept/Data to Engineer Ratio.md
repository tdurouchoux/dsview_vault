The Data-to-Engineer Ratio is a metric that compares the size of data and product teams to the size of engineering teams within an organization. This ratio provides insight into how resources are allocated between data-driven initiatives and traditional software development. A higher ratio might indicate a stronger emphasis on data and analytics, while a lower ratio could suggest a focus on engineering and product development. This metric is useful for benchmarking and understanding the strategic priorities of a company.
