TinyML, or Tiny Machine Learning, refers to a subset of machine learning techniques designed to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers and edge devices. It focuses on optimizing machine learning models to operate with minimal computational power, memory, and energy consumption. TinyML enables the deployment of AI capabilities in small, low-power devices, making it possible to perform on-device inference and learning tasks in applications like IoT, wearable devices, and sensors.
