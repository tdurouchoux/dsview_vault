Batching and streaming are concepts used in data processing and model serving. Batching involves grouping multiple data samples together to be processed simultaneously, which can improve efficiency and throughput. Streaming, on the other hand, involves processing data continuously as it arrives, which can reduce latency and improve real-time performance. These techniques are often used together to optimize the performance of AI models in production environments.
