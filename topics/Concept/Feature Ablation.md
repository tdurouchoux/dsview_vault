Feature ablation is a technique used to measure the full, potentially nonlinear causal effect of a feature's activation on the model's output. In the context of interpretability, feature ablation involves clamping a feature's value to zero at a specific token position during a forward pass. This method helps in understanding the role of features in the model's decision-making process and in assessing their influence on the model's outputs. Feature ablation is a valuable tool for analyzing the model's behavior and for identifying the features that are most relevant to a specific output.
