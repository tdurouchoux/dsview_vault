CUDA Cores are the fundamental processing units within a GPU's Streaming Multiprocessor (SM), responsible for executing general-purpose computations. Each CUDA Core can perform arithmetic operations, such as additions and multiplications, and is part of a larger group of cores that execute the same instruction simultaneously. CUDA Cores are essential for tasks like vector arithmetic, reductions, and other operations that require parallel processing. Modern GPUs, like the NVIDIA H100 and B200, have multiple CUDA Cores per SM, enabling high-performance computing for machine learning and data science applications.
