Keyword-only and Positional-only Arguments in Python allow you to control how arguments are passed to functions. Keyword-only arguments, marked by an asterisk (*), must be passed as keyword arguments, while Positional-only arguments, marked by a forward slash (/), must be passed positionally. This feature is particularly useful for API developers to enforce specific argument usage.
