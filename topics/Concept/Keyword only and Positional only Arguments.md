Keyword-only and Positional-only Arguments in Python allow developers to control how arguments are passed to functions. Keyword-only arguments, marked by an asterisk (*), must be passed as keyword arguments, while positional-only arguments, marked by a forward slash (/), must be passed positionally. This feature enhances API design by enforcing specific argument-passing styles, improving code clarity and reducing errors.
