All MiniLM L6 v2 is a sentence embedding model developed by the researchers at the University of Berlin. It is designed to convert sentences or short texts into dense vector representations, capturing semantic meaning. This model is particularly useful for tasks like semantic search, clustering, and information retrieval, where understanding the context and meaning of text is crucial. The model is trained on a diverse range of text data, making it versatile for various applications in natural language processing.
