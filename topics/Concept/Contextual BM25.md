Contextual BM25 is a sub-technique of Contextual Retrieval that involves creating a BM25 index with chunk-specific explanatory context prepended to each chunk. BM25 is a ranking function that uses lexical matching to find precise word or phrase matches, which is particularly effective for queries that include unique identifiers or technical terms. By combining Contextual Embeddings and Contextual BM25, traditional RAG systems can provide more comprehensive and accurate results.
