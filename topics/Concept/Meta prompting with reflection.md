Meta-prompting with reflection is an enhanced version of meta-prompting that allows the LLM to use 'think' and 'critique' tools before committing to a prompt update. This technique enables the LLM to analyze previous prompts more thoroughly and identify hidden patterns in the data distribution, leading to more targeted improvements.
