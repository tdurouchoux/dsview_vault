Human-centered design is an approach to designing technology and systems that prioritizes the needs, preferences, and behaviors of end-users. In the context of AI-powered data analysis tools, human-centered design principles aim to facilitate intuitive interactions, build user trust, and streamline the analysis workflow. This involves creating user interfaces that are easy to navigate, providing clear explanations of AI-generated outputs, and ensuring that the tools are accessible to users with varying levels of expertise. By focusing on the user experience, human-centered design helps to make data analysis more accessible and efficient.
