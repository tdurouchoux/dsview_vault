SmolAgents is an agent framework used as a baseline for evaluating AI models on their ability to predict future events. It involves deploying agents to scrape news websites, analyze articles, and generate prediction questions based on current events. The framework is designed to create a pipeline of fresh evaluation material tied to real-world events.
