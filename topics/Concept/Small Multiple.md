A small multiple is a data visualization technique that involves creating multiple similar graphs or charts, each showing a different subset of the data. This technique is particularly useful for comparing trends or patterns across different categories or groups. By presenting data in small multiples, viewers can easily compare and contrast the trends in each subset without the clutter and confusion that can arise from trying to display all the data in a single chart. This method is often used to make complex data more accessible and easier to understand.
