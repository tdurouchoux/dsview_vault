AI-assisted Red Teaming is an approach that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the capabilities of traditional red teaming exercises. By using AI agents to simulate attacks and identify vulnerabilities in AI systems, this method increases the efficiency and effectiveness of security assessments. AI-assisted Red Teaming can uncover novel attack vectors and potential risks that might be overlooked by human testers alone, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of AI system security. This approach helps organizations proactively address and mitigate security threats, ensuring the robustness and reliability of their AI technologies.
