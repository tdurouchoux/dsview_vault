AI-assisted red teaming leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the process of identifying vulnerabilities and testing the security of AI systems. This approach uses AI agents to simulate attacks, identify potential weaknesses, and assess the robustness of AI models. It complements human expertise by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of red teaming exercises, helping to uncover and mitigate risks more comprehensively.
