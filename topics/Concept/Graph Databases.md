Graph databases are specialized databases designed to store and manage graph-structured data. They use nodes to represent entities and edges to represent relationships between these entities. Graph databases are optimized for traversing relationships and are particularly useful in applications where the relationships between data points are as important as the data points themselves, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and fraud detection.
