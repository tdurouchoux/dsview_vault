The state-aware reasoning framework is a novel approach developed for the AMIE system that allows it to adapt its responses based on its internal state, which captures its knowledge about the patient at a given point in the conversation. This framework enables AMIE to gather information efficiently, request relevant multimodal artifacts, interpret their findings accurately, and integrate this information seamlessly into the ongoing dialogue. By dynamically adapting its responses, the state-aware reasoning framework emulates the structured, adaptive reasoning process used by experienced clinicians.
