Local-first MLOps refers to a machine learning operations approach where all data processing, model training, and deployment occur on local or private infrastructure rather than on cloud-based platforms. This approach ensures data sovereignty, eliminates vendor lock-in, and addresses data privacy concerns. Local-first MLOps is particularly beneficial for organizations handling sensitive data, such as healthcare providers, government agencies, and research institutions, as it allows them to comply with regulations like GDPR without compromising on functionality or performance. Tools like Skyulf exemplify this approach by providing a self-hosted environment for end-to-end machine learning workflows.
