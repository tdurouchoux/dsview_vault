Pre-training refers to the initial phase of training a machine learning model on a large dataset to learn general features and representations. This phase is often followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. In the context of NLP, pre-training has been a significant breakthrough, enabling models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Pretraining language models involves training a model on a large corpus of text data to learn general language patterns and representations. This initial training step is crucial for the subsequent fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages in RLHF. Pretraining can be done using various objectives, such as next token prediction, and can be fine-tuned on additional data to improve performance on specific tasks.
