Benchmarking is the process of measuring and comparing the performance of different algorithms, data structures, or implementations. In the context of Python, benchmarking can be used to evaluate the impact of different memory access patterns, cache optimizations, and other performance-related factors. Tools like hyperfine can be used to run benchmarks and compare the results, providing insights into the performance characteristics of different approaches. Effective benchmarking involves designing experiments that isolate the factors being tested and ensuring that the results are statistically significant.
