The process of representing nodes and edges of a graph in a continuous vector space. Graph embedding algorithms like those in the nodevectors library aim to preserve the structural and topological properties of the graph in the vector representations, enabling various downstream machine learning tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Node representation learning refers to the process of mapping nodes in a graph to a low-dimensional vector space while preserving the structural and attribute information of the nodes. Techniques like DeepWalk, TransE, and node2vec are commonly used for this purpose.
