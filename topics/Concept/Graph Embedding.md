Graph embeddings are representations that capture the relationships between nodes in a graph and preserve the structure of nodes and edges. Unlike regular neural network embeddings, graph embeddings focus on modeling relational structures within graphs. They enable the integration of graph data with neural networks, facilitating tasks like node classification and link prediction. This technique is used to map nodes and edges of a graph to a low-dimensional vector space, capturing the structural and topological properties of the graph, making it easier to analyze and visualize.
