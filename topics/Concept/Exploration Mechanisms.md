Exploration mechanisms are strategies used to encourage exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs). These mechanisms include classic approaches like epsilon-greedy and modern LLM-specific approaches like self-correction and self-consistency. Effective exploration mechanisms are crucial for improving the decision-making abilities of LLMs by increasing exploration and narrowing the knowing-doing gap.
