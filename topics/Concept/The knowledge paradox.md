The knowledge paradox in the context of AI-assisted coding refers to the counterintuitive observation that AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. While one might expect AI to democratize coding by making it accessible to non-experts, the reality is that AI tools are most effective when used by those who have a deep understanding of software development principles. Experienced developers can guide and refine the AI's output, while beginners may accept the AI's suggestions without fully understanding the underlying principles, leading to fragile and poorly maintained code. This paradox highlights the importance of combining AI tools with human expertise to achieve the best results.
