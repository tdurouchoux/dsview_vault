Offline reinforcement learning, also known as batch reinforcement learning, involves learning policies from pre-collected datasets without interacting with the environment during training. This approach is useful when real-world interactions are expensive or risky. Techniques like Batch Constrained deep Q-learning (BCQ) and Behavioral Cloning are examples of offline RL.
