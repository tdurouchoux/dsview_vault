A neural process is a type of machine learning model that can handle off-the-grid and missing data, providing probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations. It is particularly useful for complex environmental data, such as in climate downscaling and sensor placement. Neural processes are flexible and can be trained to learn from diverse data modalities, making them suitable for tasks like weather forecasting.
