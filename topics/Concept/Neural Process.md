A neural process is a type of machine learning model that combines the flexibility of neural networks with the ability to handle off-the-grid and missing data. It is designed to learn mappings from input data to output predictions while accounting for uncertainties and providing probabilistic predictions. Neural processes are particularly useful in environmental applications, such as climate downscaling and sensor placement, where data can be sparse or irregular. They consist of an encoder module that processes input data, a processor module that generates forecasts, and a decoder module that produces final predictions.
