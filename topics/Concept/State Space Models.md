State space models (SSMs) provide a powerful and flexible framework for time series forecasting, capable of handling complex dynamics such as time-varying trends, multiple seasonality patterns, and the influence of external regressors. These models decompose the time series into distinct, understandable components, making it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders. State space models are particularly useful for their interpretability and ability to incorporate domain knowledge through informative priors on the variance parameters.
