State space models (SSMs) provide a powerful and flexible framework for time series forecasting. They handle complex dynamics, including time-varying trends, multiple seasonality patterns, and the influence of external regressors. SSMs decompose time series into distinct components, making them interpretable and useful for understanding the factors driving forecasts. They are particularly valuable in business contexts where understanding the why behind predictions is as important as the predictions themselves.
