Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture introduced to handle sequential data without relying on recurrence or convolution. They use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input data, making them highly effective for tasks like language translation, text generation, and various NLP applications. Transformers have become foundational in modern AI, particularly with the advent of large language models.
