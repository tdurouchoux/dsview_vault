Multimodal perception and reasoning refer to the ability of an AI system to process and interpret information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and documents, to make informed decisions. In the context of AMIE, this capability allows the system to request, interpret, and reason about visual medical information during clinical dialogues. By integrating multimodal perception and reasoning, AMIE can provide more accurate diagnoses and management plans, emulating the comprehensive assessment processes used by healthcare professionals. This approach leverages advanced models like Gemini to handle complex medical data and scenarios effectively.
