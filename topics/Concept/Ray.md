Ray is a distributed computing framework that simplifies the process of building and scaling parallel and distributed applications. It provides a simple primitive for creating and managing distributed actors and tasks, making it easy to parallelize workloads across multiple cores or machines. Ray is used in DataTrove to launch pipelines on a ray cluster, utilizing ray tasks for parallel execution. This allows for efficient and scalable data processing, leveraging the distributed computing capabilities of the ray framework.
