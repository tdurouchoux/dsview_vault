The winner's curse is a phenomenon in statistical analysis, particularly in A/B testing, where the estimated effect of a treatment is exaggerated due to selective reporting or optional stopping. It occurs when the treatment appears more effective than it truly is because the experiment was stopped early or because only significant results are reported. The winner's curse can lead to overestimation of the treatment effect and poor decision-making if not properly accounted for.
