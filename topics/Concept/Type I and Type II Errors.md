Type I and Type II errors are fundamental concepts in statistical hypothesis testing. A Type I error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected, leading to a false positive. The probability of a Type I error is controlled by the significance level (alpha). A Type II error occurs when a false null hypothesis is not rejected, leading to a false negative. The probability of a Type II error is related to the statistical power of the test, which is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Balancing these error rates is crucial for accurate statistical inferences.
