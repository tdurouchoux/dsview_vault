Dumbbell plots are a type of visualization used to demonstrate changes between two sets of data points. They are particularly useful for comparing values across two different time periods or conditions. Each 'dumbbell' consists of two dots connected by a line, where each dot represents a value in one of the sets, and the line indicates the relationship or change between them. This type of plot is effective for visualizing trends, differences, or progress over time, such as life expectancy changes in different countries.
