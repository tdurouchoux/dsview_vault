Dumbbell plots are a type of visualization used to demonstrate changes between two sets of data points. They are particularly useful for comparing values across two different time periods or conditions, such as life expectancy in different years. Each 'dumbbell' consists of two dots connected by a line, where each dot represents a value in one of the sets, and the line shows the connection between the two values. This type of plot is effective for visualizing trends and differences in data over time or between categories.
