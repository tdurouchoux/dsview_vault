DevOps is a paradigm that addresses social and technical issues in organizations engaged in software development. It aims to eliminate the gap between development and operations by emphasizing collaboration, communication, and knowledge sharing. DevOps ensures automation with continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment (CI/CD), allowing for fast, frequent, and reliable releases. It also ensures continuous testing, quality assurance, continuous monitoring, logging, and feedback loops. DevOps tools can be differentiated into six groups: collaboration and knowledge sharing, source code management, build process, continuous integration, deployment automation, and monitoring and logging.
