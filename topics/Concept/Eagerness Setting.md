The Eagerness Setting is a configuration option within the Speculation Rules API that determines when and how aggressively speculation (prefetching or prerendering) should occur. It allows developers to balance between the benefits of early speculation and the costs of potential wasted resources. The setting includes options like immediate, eager, moderate, and conservative, each with different heuristics for triggering speculation.
