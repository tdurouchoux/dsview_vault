Computer Use is a groundbreaking capability introduced by Anthropic, allowing AI models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet to interact with computers in a manner similar to human users. This includes navigating interfaces, using standard tools, and performing tasks that require multiple steps, such as data entry, research, and software testing. This capability is still experimental and is being released for developer feedback and improvement.
