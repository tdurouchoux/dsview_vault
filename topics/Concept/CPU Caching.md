CPU caching refers to the use of smaller, faster memory caches to store frequently accessed data from the main memory (RAM). This technique is employed to reduce the time it takes for the CPU to access data, thereby improving overall system performance. The CPU cache hierarchy typically includes L1, L2, and L3 caches, each with different sizes and speeds. Effective cache management can significantly impact the performance of both low-level languages like C++ and Rust, as well as higher-level languages like Python.
