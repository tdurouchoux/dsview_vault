CPU caching refers to the mechanism where the CPU stores frequently accessed data from the main memory (RAM) in smaller, faster memory caches (L1, L2, L3) to reduce access time. This process is crucial for performance optimization, especially in high-performance computing environments. The CPU uses various strategies to predict and pre-load data into the cache, which can significantly impact the speed of data access and overall system performance.
