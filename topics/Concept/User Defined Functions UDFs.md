User-Defined Functions (UDFs) are custom functions created by users to perform specific operations that are not covered by the native API of a data processing library. In the context of Polars, UDFs allow users to incorporate custom logic and leverage other Python libraries for domain-specific problems, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of the DataFrame operations.
