Master Data Management (MDM) is a discipline that focuses on the management of critical data entities of an organization to provide a single point of reference. In the context of GenBI, MDM involves the integration of AI models into the data management process to validate and generate data artifacts, such as dashboards, metrics, and data models. This approach ensures that the generated artifacts are accurate, contextually relevant, and aligned with business requirements, enhancing the overall data analytics experience.
