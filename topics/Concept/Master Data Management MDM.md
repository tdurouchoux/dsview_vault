Master Data Management (MDM) is a discipline that involves creating a single source of truth for an organization's critical data entities, such as customers, products, and locations. MDM ensures data consistency, accuracy, and reliability across the organization. In the context of GenBI, MDM processes can be enhanced with AI models to validate and iterate on generated data artifacts, ensuring data quality and consistency.
