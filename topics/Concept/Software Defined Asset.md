Software-Defined Assets are stateful assets that incorporate declarative capabilities, such as defining update schedules or automatic versioning. These assets can be managed more effectively within a declarative data stack, ensuring that they can be recreated or updated based on changes in the stack's configuration. This approach simplifies data governance and ensures that data assets behave more declaratively.
