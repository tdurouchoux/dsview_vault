Software-Defined Assets are stateful data assets that incorporate declarative capabilities, allowing for the definition of behaviors such as daily updates or automatic versioning. These assets can automatically backfill required data if the declaration of the data stack changes, ensuring data governance and security rules are embedded and automatically enforced. This approach simplifies data governance by making data assets behave more declaratively.
