Period data and cohort data are two different ways of measuring and analyzing data over time. Period data refers to measurements taken from all age groups within a specific time period, such as all age groups in the year 2019. Cohort data, on the other hand, refers to measurements taken from a specific group of individuals (a cohort) as they age, such as babies born in 2019 and followed over time. Understanding the difference between these two types of data is crucial for accurate data analysis and interpretation, especially in fields like demography and epidemiology.
