Policy-based methods in reinforcement learning focus on directly learning the policy that maps states to actions, rather than learning a value function. These methods are particularly useful in continuous action spaces and can avoid some of the issues associated with value-based methods, such as overestimation of values. Algorithms like REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) fall under this category.
