UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space, typically 2D or 3D. It is particularly useful for identifying clusters and patterns in data, such as grouping Magic cards by color and type. UMAP preserves both local and global data structures, making it effective for exploratory data analysis and visualization. In Latent Scope, UMAP is used to reduce the dimensionality of embedding vectors, allowing for interactive visualization and clustering of data points.
