Data Governance is the process of managing data availability, usability, integrity, and security in an organization. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards for data management to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. Effective data governance helps organizations make informed decisions, comply with regulations, and mitigate risks. It also includes making data and features easily accessible and manageable while ensuring data security and compliance. This includes assigning roles to users, configuring data access, automating masking of sensitive data, and propagating data policies to maintain consistency and protect sensitive information.
