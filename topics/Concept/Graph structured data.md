Graph-structured data represents entities as nodes (or vertices) and relationships between them as edges (or links). This data can include attributes associated with nodes and edges. Graphs can be homogeneous (with nodes and links of one type), heterogeneous (with more than one type of nodes and/or links), or knowledge graphs (extremely heterogeneous graphs with thousands of types of edges). StellarGraph supports the analysis of various kinds of graphs, including those with or without node data and those with edge weights.
