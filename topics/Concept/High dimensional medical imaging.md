High-dimensional medical imaging refers to the interpretation and analysis of complex, multi-dimensional medical images such as CT scans, MRI scans, and histopathology slides. This type of imaging involves processing and understanding volumetric data, which can provide detailed insights into medical conditions. MedGemma 1.5 4B supports high-dimensional medical imaging, enabling developers to create applications that can handle and interpret these complex data types.
