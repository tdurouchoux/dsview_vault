Multimodal Large Language Models are designed to process and generate text in conjunction with other data types, such as images, audio, and video. These models leverage multiple modalities to enhance understanding and generation capabilities, enabling applications like image captioning, visual question answering, and multimedia content creation. These models are designed to perform tasks that require the integration of information from different modalities, enabling more complex and nuanced understanding and reasoning.
