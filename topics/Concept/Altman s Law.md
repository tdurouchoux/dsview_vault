Altmanâ€™s Law suggests that the rapid advancements in machine learning models will make it necessary for products to be designed in a way that allows for easy model swapping. This law emphasizes the importance of building flexible systems that can adapt to new models as they become available, rather than relying on a single, static model. By designing products with this flexibility in mind, companies can take advantage of the continuous improvements in model performance and capabilities.
