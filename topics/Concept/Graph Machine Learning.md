Graph Machine Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data. It involves the development and application of algorithms that can process and learn from the complex relationships and interactions represented in graphs. This includes tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection, leveraging the unique structure of graph data to improve predictive models and uncover insights.
