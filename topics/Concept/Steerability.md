Steerability in the context of Copilot Workspace refers to the ability of developers to guide and edit the system's actions through natural language. This involves altering specifications and plans, which helps ensure the generated code is more accurate and aligned with the developer's intent. Steerability allows developers to edit the current and desired states of the codebase, modify the plan of action, and tweak the generated code before finalizing changes.
