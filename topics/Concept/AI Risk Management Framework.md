The AI Risk Management Framework is a structured approach developed by organizations like NIST to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with AI systems. It typically includes processes for governing, mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks throughout the AI lifecycle. The framework aims to ensure that AI is developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, secure, and aligned with ethical principles.
