A DataFrame is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). DataFrames are commonly used in data analysis and processing tasks, providing a convenient way to store and manipulate structured data. They are a fundamental data structure in many data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, Dask, and Polars.
