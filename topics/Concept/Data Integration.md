Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources to provide a unified view of the data. It involves extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources into a single repository, such as a data warehouse or data lake, where it can be analyzed and used for decision-making. Data integration is crucial for businesses that need to analyze large volumes of data from multiple sources to gain insights and make informed decisions. Effective data integration requires addressing issues such as data quality, data consistency, and data security.
