Mobile Actions is an evaluation and fine-tuning framework for assessing the performance of models like FunctionGemma on mobile devices. It involves reimagining assistant interactions as fully offline capabilities, where the model parses natural language commands and identifies the correct OS tools to execute the commands. Mobile Actions is used to demonstrate the model's ability to handle common commands and automate complex, multi-step workflows on edge devices.
