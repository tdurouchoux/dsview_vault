The condition number is a measure of the sensitivity of a function or matrix to small perturbations. In optimization, it is defined as the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix. A high condition number indicates ill-conditioned problems, leading to slow convergence and numerical instability. The condition number helps in understanding the difficulty of the optimization problem and guides the choice of optimization algorithms and parameters.
