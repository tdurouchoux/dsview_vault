The condition number is a measure of the sensitivity of the output of a function to changes or errors in the input. In the context of optimization, it quantifies how well-conditioned a matrix is, indicating the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue. A high condition number suggests that the matrix is ill-conditioned, leading to numerical instability and slow convergence in optimization algorithms.
