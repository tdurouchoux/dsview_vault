The MCPDoc server is an open-source tool designed to provide coding agents with access to library documentation. It exposes tools like list_doc_sources and fetch_docs, which allow agents to retrieve specific documentation pages as needed. This helps agents access relevant information without being overwhelmed by large amounts of text, improving their performance and accuracy.
