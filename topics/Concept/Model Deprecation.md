Model deprecation involves the removal of models from the Chatbot Arena leaderboard. This process can be influenced by various factors such as the availability of newer models, performance metrics, and provider policies. However, the deprecation process can introduce inconsistencies and biases, particularly when it disproportionately affects open-weight and open-source models.
