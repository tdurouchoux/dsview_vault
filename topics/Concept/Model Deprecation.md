Model deprecation in AI model evaluations refers to the process of removing or reducing the sampling rates of models from the evaluation platform, often due to performance criteria or policy decisions. This practice can impact the reliability and fairness of leaderboard rankings, particularly if deprecation policies are not applied uniformly across different types of models. Ensuring transparent and equitable deprecation policies is essential for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of AI model evaluations.
