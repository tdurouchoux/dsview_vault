Solidarity at Source is a system implemented in France to simplify the declaration of resources for certain benefits, such as the RSA (Revenue de Solidarité Active) and the prime d'activité (activity premium). It involves pre-filled declarations based on data already held by the authorities, reducing the burden on beneficiaries. The DMDE 2026 model is adapted to this new declarative context, with separate models for periods before and after the implementation of Solidarity at Source.
