Typing Overloads in Python allow developers to define multiple signatures for the same function using the @overload decorator from the typing module. This feature helps the type checker expect different types based on specific parameters, enhancing type safety and code clarity. It is particularly useful for functions that can return different types based on input arguments, ensuring that the type checker can validate the correct return types.
