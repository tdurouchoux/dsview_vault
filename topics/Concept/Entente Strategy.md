The concept of an 'Entente Strategy' refers to a diplomatic and strategic approach aimed at forming a coalition of democratic nations to gain a competitive advantage in the development and deployment of advanced artificial intelligence (AI). This strategy involves securing the supply chain for critical AI technologies, scaling up AI capabilities rapidly, and blocking or delaying adversarial access to key resources such as semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The Entente Strategy seeks to create a world where democracies lead on the global stage, using AI to achieve robust military superiority and economic strength. By offering to distribute the benefits of powerful AI to a wider group of countries in exchange for supporting the coalition's strategy to promote democracy, the Entente Strategy aims to isolate adversaries and eventually persuade them to adopt a more cooperative approach. This concept emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and strategic planning in shaping a future where AI is used to advance democratic values and global stability.
