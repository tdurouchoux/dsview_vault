attri2vec is an algorithm for node representation learning, node classification, and out-of-sample node link prediction for homogeneous graphs with node attributes. It leverages node attributes to learn embeddings that capture both the structure of the graph and the features of the nodes. These embeddings can then be used in downstream machine learning tasks, such as node classification and link prediction.
