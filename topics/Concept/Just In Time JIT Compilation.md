Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation is a technique used to convert Python functions into optimized parallel binaries at runtime. This process enhances performance by compiling code on the fly, allowing for efficient execution of both Pandas and Numpy operations. JIT compilation is particularly beneficial for data-intensive tasks, providing significant speedups by leveraging parallel processing and optimization.
