Custom Agents are specialized AI entities that can be created within the Notion platform. They are designed to automate specific workflows and can be shared with teams. These agents can be set to work on autopilot, triggered by schedules or specific events, and can perform tasks such as compiling feedback, posting updates, and triaging requests.
