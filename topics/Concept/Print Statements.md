Print statements allow you to insert messages in your code that get printed to the console or terminal when the program runs. By strategically placing print statements at different parts of your code, you can create a log of sorts that shows the order in which different sections of your code are being executed. This can help you understand the control flow and pinpoint where the program might be deviating from your expectations.
