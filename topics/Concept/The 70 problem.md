The 70% problem refers to the observation that AI-assisted coding tools can quickly generate a working prototype or solution that covers about 70% of the requirements. However, the remaining 30% often requires significant effort and expertise to refine, debug, and make the solution production-ready. This problem highlights the limitations of current AI tools in handling complex, edge cases, and ensuring the robustness and maintainability of the code. It underscores the need for human oversight and expertise to bridge the gap between a functional prototype and a polished, production-ready application.
