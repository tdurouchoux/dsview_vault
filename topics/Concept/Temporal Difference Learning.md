Temporal Difference (TD) Learning is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning where an agent learns to predict future rewards by bootstrapping from its current estimates. It combines the ideas of Monte Carlo methods and dynamic programming, allowing for efficient learning directly from raw experience without needing a model of the environment. TD learning has been instrumental in achieving superhuman performance in various tasks, such as backgammon.
