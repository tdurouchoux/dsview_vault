The Simplified Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) is an extension of the GCN algorithm that simplifies the graph convolution process by smoothing the graph to bring in more distant neighbors of nodes without using multiple layers. This simplification reduces the computational complexity and makes the model easier to train and interpret. SGC supports representation learning and node classification for homogeneous graphs and is implemented in libraries like StellarGraph.
