Propensity score is a concept in statistics that refers to the probability of a unit (e.g., a person, an item) being assigned to a particular treatment or condition given a set of observed covariates. Propensity scores are used to reduce bias in observational studies by matching treated and untreated units with similar propensity scores, thereby creating a balanced sample that mimics a randomized experiment.
