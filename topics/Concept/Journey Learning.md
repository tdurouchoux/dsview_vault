Journey learning is an alternative approach to traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) that includes both correct and incorrect solution paths in the training data. This method aims to improve the model's ability to learn from mistakes and reinforce self-correction abilities. By exposing the model to incorrect reasoning paths and their corrections, journey learning may make reasoning models more reliable. This approach is particularly relevant for low-budget reasoning model development where reinforcement learning (RL) may be computationally impractical.
