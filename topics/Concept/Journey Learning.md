Journey learning is an approach to training language models that includes both correct and incorrect solution paths in the training data. This method aims to improve the model's ability to learn from mistakes and reinforce self-correction abilities. By exposing the model to incorrect reasoning paths and their corrections, journey learning can make reasoning models more reliable and capable of handling complex tasks effectively.
