On-policy reinforcement learning involves learning from the current policy being used, while off-policy reinforcement learning involves learning from a different policy. The text explains how nondeterminism in inference can turn on-policy methods into off-policy ones, leading to inconsistencies in training. Batch-invariant kernels help achieve true on-policy reinforcement learning by ensuring deterministic inference.
