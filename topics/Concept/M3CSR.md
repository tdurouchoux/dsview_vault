M3CSR (Multimodal Content-Sequence Representation) is a framework that introduces multimodal content embeddings (visual, textual, audio) clustered via K-means into trainable category IDs. This transforms static content embeddings into adaptable, behavior-aligned representations, improving recommendation performance and user engagement.
