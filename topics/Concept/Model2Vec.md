Model2Vec is a method for creating static embeddings using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It is notable for producing multilingual models and glove-based models that perform well in word similarity tasks. Model2Vec embeddings are used in various NLP applications, including text classification, information retrieval, and semantic search, providing efficient and effective representations of text data.
