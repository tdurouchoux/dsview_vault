The retriever is a crucial component in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, responsible for retrieving relevant documents from a vast knowledge base. The effectiveness of the retriever is determined by its ability to acquire accurate semantic representations, match the semantic spaces of queries and documents, and align the output of the retriever with the preferences of the large language model (LLM). Techniques such as chunk optimization and fine-tuning embedding models are employed to enhance the retriever's performance. The retriever plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the retrieved information is accurate, relevant, and aligned with the needs of the LLM, thereby improving the overall quality of the generated responses.
