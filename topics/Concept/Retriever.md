The retriever is a crucial component in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, responsible for retrieving relevant documents from a vast knowledge base. The retriever's performance is evaluated based on its ability to acquire accurate semantic representations, match the semantic spaces of queries and documents, and align the output with the preferences of the large language model (LLM). Techniques such as chunk optimization and fine-tuning embedding models are employed to enhance the retriever's effectiveness. The retriever plays a vital role in ensuring that the retrieved documents are relevant and accurate, thereby improving the overall quality of the generated responses.
