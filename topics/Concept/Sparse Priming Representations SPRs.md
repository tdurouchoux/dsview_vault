Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) is a technique used to summarize and optimize the content of documents for use in language models. By condensing the information into a more concise and relevant format, SPRs help reduce the number of tokens used by the model, improving performance and efficiency. This technique is particularly useful in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to enhance the quality of retrieved information.
