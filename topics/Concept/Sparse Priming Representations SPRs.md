Sparse Priming Representations (SPRs) are a technique used to optimize the content of documents for use in language models, particularly in the context of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). SPRs involve summarizing the content of a document into a more concise and model-optimized representation. This summarized content is then stored in a vector store and used to retrieve relevant information during the RAG process. The goal of SPRs is to reduce the number of tokens used by the model, improve the performance of the prediction, and enhance the relevance of the retrieved information. By compressing documents into their essential elements, SPRs help to widen the knowledge space and reduce duplication, leading to more efficient and effective information retrieval.
