Causal reasoning is the ability to understand and infer cause-and-effect relationships. In the context of AI, causal reasoning enables systems to make informed decisions, evaluate the impact of hypothetical actions, and provide reliable recommendations. It is crucial for tasks involving diagnosis, planning, or prediction, especially in dynamic and uncertain environments. Causal reasoning helps AI systems to generalize beyond narrow, predefined training scenarios and to adapt to new situations.
