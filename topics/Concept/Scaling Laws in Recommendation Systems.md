Scaling laws in recommendation systems refer to the predictable power-law relationship between model size, data quantity, and performance. Larger models and datasets generally lead to better performance, but the relationship is complex and influenced by factors such as model architecture, training techniques, and data characteristics. Understanding these scaling laws helps in optimizing the design and training of recommendation models.
