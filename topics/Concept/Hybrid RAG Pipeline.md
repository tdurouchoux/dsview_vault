A Hybrid RAG Pipeline combines both full-text and vector-based retrieval methods to enhance the quality of information retrieval in RAG systems. Full-text retrieval involves searching for exact matches of query terms within documents, while vector-based retrieval converts documents and queries into numerical vectors and uses similarity measures to find relevant documents. By combining these methods, a hybrid RAG pipeline aims to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information, ensuring better performance in question-answering tasks. Kotaemon uses a hybrid RAG pipeline to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses.
