Continuous ML training and evaluation involves periodic retraining of machine learning models based on new feature data. This process is enabled through the support of a monitoring component, feedback loops, and an automated ML workflow pipeline. Continuous training ensures that models remain accurate and up-to-date, while continuous evaluation assesses the change in model quality. This practice is essential for maintaining the performance and reliability of ML models in production environments.
