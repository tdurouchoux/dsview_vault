Continuous ML training involves periodic retraining of the ML model based on new feature data. Continuous training is enabled through the support of a monitoring component, a feedback loop, and an automated ML workflow pipeline. Continuous training always includes an evaluation run to assess the change in model quality, ensuring that the model remains accurate and effective over time.
