Multi-Agent Systems are AI systems composed of multiple specialized agents that work together to perform complex tasks. These systems leverage the strengths of individual agents to achieve goals that would be difficult or impossible for a single agent to accomplish alone. Multi-Agent Systems are particularly useful for applications that require collaboration, coordination, and distributed problem-solving, such as research assistance and task management.
