Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while retaining the essential patterns and relationships. In the context of topic modeling, dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of dimensions in the embedding space, making it easier to visualize and cluster the data. Common algorithms for dimensionality reduction include UMAP and PCA.
