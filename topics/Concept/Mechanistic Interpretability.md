Mechanistic Interpretability is an approach to understanding the inner workings of large language models by decomposing them into smaller, interpretable components. This method involves analyzing the role of each component and understanding how they interact to produce specific behaviors. By breaking down the model into its constituent parts, researchers can gain insights into important behaviors such as hallucination, planning, reasoning, and emergent capabilities. Mechanistic interpretability aims to provide a clearer understanding of how models generate outputs, ultimately enhancing the transparency and reliability of AI systems.
