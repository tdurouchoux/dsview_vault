Mechanistic Interpretability is an approach to understanding large language models by decomposing them into smaller, interpretable components and analyzing how these components contribute to the model's behavior. This method aims to provide insights into how models perform tasks, such as reasoning, planning, and generating responses, by examining the internal workings of the model. Mechanistic interpretability helps identify and explain behaviors like hallucination, faithfulness, and emergent capabilities, offering a deeper understanding of model functionalities and potential improvements.
