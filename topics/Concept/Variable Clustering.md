Variable clustering is a statistical technique used to group similar variables together based on their relationships or patterns. This approach is often used to reduce the dimensionality of data, identify redundant or collinear variables, and improve the interpretability of complex datasets. Variable clustering can be particularly useful in medical research for summarizing patient characteristics and relating them to outcomes.
