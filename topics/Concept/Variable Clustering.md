Variable clustering is a technique used to group variables (features) based on their similarities or correlations. This approach is often more informative and less arbitrary than patient clustering, as it does not discard as much information and better handles collinearities and redundancies among variables. It can be combined with methods like sparse principal components analysis (PCA) to provide a more sparse and interpretable representation of the data.
