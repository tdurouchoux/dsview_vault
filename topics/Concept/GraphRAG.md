GraphRAG is an indexing pipeline that leverages graph-based structures to enhance the retrieval quality in RAG systems. It is designed to work with OpenAI or Ollama API and can be integrated with Kotaemon to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. GraphRAG uses graph structures to represent and retrieve information, making it particularly useful for complex queries and multi-hop reasoning.
