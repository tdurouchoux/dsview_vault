GraphRAG is a technique that combines graph-based retrieval with RAG to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information. It involves constructing a knowledge graph from the documents and using graph-based methods to retrieve relevant information. GraphRAG can help capture the relationships and dependencies between different pieces of information, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In the context of Kotaemon, GraphRAG is used as an optional indexing pipeline to enhance the retrieval quality of the RAG system.
