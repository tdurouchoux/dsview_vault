The Brier score is a measure of the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. It is the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. A lower Brier score indicates better predictive performance, with the best possible score being 0, which occurs when the model is perfectly calibrated and accurate.
