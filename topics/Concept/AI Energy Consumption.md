AI Energy Consumption refers to the amount of energy required to train and operate artificial intelligence models. This includes the energy used for data processing, model training, and inference. The energy consumption of AI is a significant concern due to its environmental impact, as data centers and AI infrastructure require substantial amounts of electricity, often sourced from fossil fuels. The carbon footprint of AI is a growing area of research and debate, as the industry seeks to balance the benefits of AI with its environmental costs.
