Secure SSH configuration involves setting up the SSH server to use strong encryption algorithms, disabling insecure protocols, and implementing strict access controls. This includes configuring the SSH daemon (sshd) to use modern cryptographic algorithms like Ed25519 for host keys, disabling root login, and limiting user access. Additionally, it involves setting up SSH to use public key authentication, disabling password authentication, and configuring SSH to use a non-standard port to reduce exposure to automated attacks. These measures help to protect the server from unauthorized access and potential security breaches.
