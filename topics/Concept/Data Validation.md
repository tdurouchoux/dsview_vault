Data validation is the process of ensuring that the data entered into a system is accurate, consistent, and reliable. It involves setting rules and constraints to check the quality of data, such as restricting the type and range of values, ensuring uniqueness, and validating formats. Data validation helps prevent errors, improve data quality, and ensure that the data collected is usable for analysis and reporting.
