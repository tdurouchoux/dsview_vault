Exogenous variables, also known as explanatory variables, are external factors that influence the behavior of the time series being forecasted. Incorporating exogenous variables into forecasting models can significantly improve their performance by capturing the impact of external factors on the time series. These variables can include economic indicators, weather data, and other relevant external data sources.
