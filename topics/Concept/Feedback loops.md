Feedback loops in MLOps are mechanisms that integrate insights from the quality assessment step into the development or engineering process. They enable continuous training, retraining, and improvement of ML models. Feedback loops can be established from various stages, such as the experimental model engineering stage to the previous feature engineering stage, or from the monitoring component to the scheduler to enable retraining.
