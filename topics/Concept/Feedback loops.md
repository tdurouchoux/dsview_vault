Feedback loops in MLOps are mechanisms that integrate insights from the quality assessment step into the development or engineering process. They enable continuous training, retraining, and improvement of ML models. Feedback loops can be established from various stages, such as the experimental model engineering stage or the monitoring component observing the model serving performance. These loops ensure that models are continuously improved and adapted to changing conditions, enhancing their accuracy and reliability.
