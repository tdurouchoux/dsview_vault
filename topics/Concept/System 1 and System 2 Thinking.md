System 1 and System 2 thinking are concepts from cognitive psychology that describe two different modes of thought. System 1 thinking is fast, automatic, and intuitive, often associated with pattern recognition and memorization. System 2 thinking is slower, more deliberate, and analytical, involving reasoning and problem-solving. In the context of AI, the distinction between these two types of thinking is important for understanding the limitations of current AI models, which excel at System 1 tasks but struggle with System 2 tasks that require reasoning and adaptation.
