System 1 and System 2 thinking are concepts from cognitive psychology that describe two different modes of thought. System 1 thinking is fast, automatic, and intuitive, while System 2 thinking is slower, more deliberative, and analytical. In the context of artificial intelligence, System 1 thinking is associated with pattern recognition and memorization, while System 2 thinking is associated with planning, reasoning, and problem-solving. The development of AI that can effectively combine both types of thinking is seen as a crucial step towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).
