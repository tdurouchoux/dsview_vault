Skills in the context of Claude Code refer to the ability of the AI to interact with the environment through scripting and CLIs, rather than relying on rigid, API-like tools. This approach allows the agent to dynamically write and execute code to perform tasks, making it more flexible and robust. Skills formalize this scripting-based agent model, providing a more organized and shareable way to document and expose these capabilities to the agent. Agent Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks. They extend the capabilities of general-purpose agents by packaging expertise into composable resources, transforming them into specialized agents. Skills are designed with progressive disclosure, allowing agents to load information only as needed, making them flexible and scalable. They can include code for execution and additional context files for detailed instructions, enhancing the agent's ability to handle complex tasks efficiently.
