The study and analysis of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a groundbreaking model in natural language processing. BERTology involves understanding how BERT works, its architectural innovations, and its impact on various NLP tasks. Researchers in this field explore techniques to improve BERT, adapt it to different languages and domains, and develop new models inspired by its architecture. BERTology has significantly advanced the field by providing deeper insights into the capabilities and limitations of transformer-based models.
