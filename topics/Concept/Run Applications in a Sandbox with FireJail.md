Running applications in a sandbox with FireJail involves using the FireJail tool to create an isolated environment for applications. This environment restricts the application's access to the system, limiting its ability to make changes or access sensitive data. FireJail is used to create a sandbox for applications like browsers and email clients, which are particularly vulnerable to security threats. This measure helps to prevent malicious applications from causing harm to the system or accessing sensitive data.
