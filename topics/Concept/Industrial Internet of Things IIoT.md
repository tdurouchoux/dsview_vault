The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles, buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity—which enables these objects to collect and exchange data. In an industrial context, IIoT involves the use of sensors and other devices to monitor and control industrial processes, improving efficiency, productivity, and safety. IIoT is a key component of digital transformation in manufacturing and industrial settings.
