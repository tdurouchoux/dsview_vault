Model Optimization is the process of improving the performance of a machine learning model, often by reducing its computational complexity, memory usage, or latency. This can involve techniques such as pruning, quantization, or distillation, as well as optimizing the model's computation graph or code. Model optimization is an important step in the deployment of machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's efficiency and scalability.
