Python sequences are ordered collections of items that can be accessed by their position or index. They include lists, tuples, and strings. Sequences support operations like slicing, concatenation, and repetition, and can be iterated over using loops. Sequences are a fundamental data structure in Python and are used extensively in data manipulation and analysis.
