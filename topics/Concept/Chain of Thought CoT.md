Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting strategy used in large language models to improve reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. It involves breaking down complex tasks into intermediate steps, allowing the model to generate more accurate and logical responses by considering each step in a sequence. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where intermediate steps of reasoning are included within the prompt, besides the task input/output. This approach significantly improves the capability of LLMs to solve problems without resorting to any model updates. CoT is a foundational concept in the development of more advanced prompting schemes like GoT.
