Chain of Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique used to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models. It involves breaking down complex problems into intermediate steps or thoughts, allowing the model to generate more accurate and logical responses by following a step-by-step reasoning process. This approach significantly improves the capability of LLMs to solve problems without resorting to any model updates and is one of the paradigms that the Graph of Thoughts framework aims to advance.
