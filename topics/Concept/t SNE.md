t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly well-suited for visualizing high-dimensional data. It emphasizes local data structures and is often used to create visually appealing embeddings that highlight clusters and patterns in the data.
