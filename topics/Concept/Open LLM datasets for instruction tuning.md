Open LLM datasets for instruction-tuning are specialized datasets used to fine-tune pre-trained large language models for specific tasks. These datasets contain examples of instructions and corresponding responses, enabling models to better understand and follow user commands. Examples include the OIG dataset and the databricks-dolly-15k dataset, which are used to improve the performance of models on instruction-following tasks.
