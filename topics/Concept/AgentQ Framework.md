The AgentQ framework is a system designed to enhance the capabilities of AI agents by integrating multiple advanced techniques, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), self-critique mechanisms, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This framework enables agents to perform complex tasks such as web scraping, form filling, and content summarization more effectively and reliably by continuously improving their decision-making processes.
