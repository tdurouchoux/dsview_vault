Agent handoffs refer to the process of transferring control or conversation from one agent to another within a multi-agent system. This mechanism allows different agents to specialize in specific tasks or functions, improving the overall efficiency and capability of the system. Handoffs can be triggered by specific conditions or user requests, enabling seamless transitions between agents to handle diverse and complex workflows.
