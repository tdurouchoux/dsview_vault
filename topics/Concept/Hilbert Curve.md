The Hilbert curve is a type of space-filling curve that maps multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving the locality of the data. It is used to improve the performance of graph algorithms by reordering edges in a way that enhances cache locality. The Hilbert curve ordering can significantly reduce the time complexity of graph computations by optimizing the way data is accessed and processed.
