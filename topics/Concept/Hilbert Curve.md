A Hilbert curve is a continuous space-filling curve that maps multidimensional data to one dimension while preserving the locality of the data. It is used to improve the performance of graph algorithms by reordering the edges of a graph based on the Hilbert curve order, which can enhance cache behavior and reduce the number of cache misses.
