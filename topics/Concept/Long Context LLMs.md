Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced versions of language models that have been trained to handle and process extended context windows. These models can manage and reason over substantial textual inputs, allowing them to assimilate extensive information in a single inference step. Long-context LLMs are particularly useful for tasks that require understanding and generating responses based on large amounts of text, such as document comprehension, multi-turn dialogue, and summarization of lengthy texts.
