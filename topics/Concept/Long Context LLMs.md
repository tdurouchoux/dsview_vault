Long-Context Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced language models designed to process and reason over substantial textual inputs. These models have extended context windows, allowing them to handle and generate responses based on larger amounts of text compared to traditional models. Long-context LLMs are particularly useful for tasks that require comprehensive understanding and generation of lengthy documents, such as document comprehension, multi-turn dialogue, and summarization. Their ability to process extensive information in a single inference step makes them well-suited for applications that require deep contextual understanding and knowledge integration.
