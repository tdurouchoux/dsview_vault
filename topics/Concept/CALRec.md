CALRec (Contrastive Alignment of Generative LLMs for Sequential Recommendation) is a two-stage framework that finetunes a pretrained LLM for sequential recommendations. It converts all input into text sequences and uses contrastive alignment to improve recommendation performance, especially in cold-start scenarios.
