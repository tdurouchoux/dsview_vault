Agentic Data Generation involves using autonomous agents, often powered by LLMs, to generate data. These agents can interact with their environment, make decisions, and create data that can be used for training or evaluation purposes. This approach leverages the capabilities of LLMs to generate diverse and complex data, mimicking real-world scenarios and interactions.
