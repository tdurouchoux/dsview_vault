Agentic Data Generation refers to the process where autonomous agents, often powered by LLMs, generate data. These agents can interact with their environment, perform tasks, and create data that can be used to train and evaluate models. Agentic data generation aims to create more realistic and diverse datasets that can improve the performance and capabilities of LLMs.
