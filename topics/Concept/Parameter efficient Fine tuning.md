Parameter-efficient fine-tuning involves methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and prompt tuning to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks with minimal changes to the original model parameters, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. These techniques provide high performance returns relative to the resources they consume, making them highly attractive for optimizing model performance.
