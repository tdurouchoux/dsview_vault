A feature API is an interface that allows data scientists to create, deploy, discover, and experiment with features. It aims to make feature engineering self-serve, enabling data scientists to work independently without needing to collaborate with data engineers. Feature APIs can support various interfaces, including Scala, SQL, and Python, to cater to different user preferences and requirements.
