A feature API allows data scientists to create, deploy, discover, and experiment with features. It should be self-serve and user-friendly, supporting interfaces like Scala, SQL, or Python to facilitate feature engineering. The API should handle both one-off batch computations and ongoing stream computations, and may separate transformation logic from feature logic to allow reuse and collaboration.
