Programmatic Prompt Engineering involves automating the process of creating and refining prompts for AI Agents using task templates, context fillers, and retrieval-augmented variables. This approach improves the generalization and reduces the brittleness of AI Agents by making the prompt engineering process more systematic and adaptable. Programmatic Prompt Engineering is essential for ensuring that AI Agents can handle a wide range of tasks and adapt to new situations effectively.
