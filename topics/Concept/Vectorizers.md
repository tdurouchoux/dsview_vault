Vectorizers are a proposed abstraction that treats vector embeddings as derived data, similar to database indexes. They automatically keep embeddings in sync with their source data, reducing the complexity and maintenance costs associated with managing vector databases. This approach aims to simplify the process of handling embeddings in AI applications.
