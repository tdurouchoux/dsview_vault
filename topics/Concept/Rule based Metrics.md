Rule-based metrics are evaluation methods that use a set of predefined rules to assess the quality of generated text or code. These rules can check for various aspects, such as syntax correctness, format consistency, language appropriateness, and the presence of specific keywords or key phrases. Rule-based metrics are particularly useful for domain-specific applications and experiments, where custom metrics tailored to the task can provide more accurate evaluations. They are often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and code generation, to ensure that the generated output meets specific quality standards. Rule-based metrics can be implemented using regular expressions, parsing techniques, or other rule-based approaches.
