Rule-based metrics are evaluation methods that use a set of predefined rules to assess the quality of generated text or code. These metrics are particularly useful for domain-specific applications and experiments. Rule-based metrics can evaluate various aspects of the generated output, such as syntax correctness, format check, language check, and keyword presence. These metrics are evaluated using rules that check for common issues or desired features in the generated output. Rule-based metrics are tailored to specific tasks and can be customized to meet the requirements of the application.
