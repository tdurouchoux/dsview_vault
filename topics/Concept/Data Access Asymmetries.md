Data access asymmetries in AI model evaluations refer to the unequal distribution of data available to different providers, which can significantly impact the performance and ranking of models. These asymmetries can arise from differences in the number of private variants tested, sampling rates, and model deprecation policies. Addressing these asymmetries is crucial for ensuring a fair and level playing field in AI model evaluations, promoting transparency and equitable access to data resources.
