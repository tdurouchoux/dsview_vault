Pooling in the context of Graph Neural Networks is a technique used to gather and aggregate information from different parts of a graph. It involves two main steps: gathering embeddings from a source (e.g., edges) and aggregating them using an operation like sum, mean, or max. Pooling is used to route information to where it is needed for prediction tasks, such as making binary classifications on nodes, edges, or global graph properties.
