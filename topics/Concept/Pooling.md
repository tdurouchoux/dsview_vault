Pooling is a technique used in Graph Neural Networks to aggregate information from neighboring nodes or edges. It involves gathering embeddings from neighboring nodes or edges and combining them using an aggregation function such as sum, mean, or max. Pooling helps to incorporate information from the graph's connectivity into the node or edge representations, enabling more informed predictions.
