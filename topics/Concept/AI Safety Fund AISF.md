The AI Safety Fund (AISF) is an initiative co-founded by the Frontier Model Forum to provide grants to researchers focused on identifying, evaluating, and mitigating risks associated with advanced AI models. The fund prioritizes critical research areas such as biosecurity, cybersecurity, and AI agent evaluation. By supporting research and development in these areas, the AISF aims to improve the safe deployment of AI technologies, ensuring they benefit society while minimizing potential harms. The fund fosters collaboration among researchers, industry experts, and institutions to advance AI safety and responsibility.
