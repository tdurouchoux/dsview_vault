Specialized facilities that house the servers, cooling systems, and other infrastructure needed to train and run AI models. These centers are critical for supporting the computational demands of AI, but they also consume large amounts of energy and have significant environmental impacts. The design, location, and energy sources of these data centers are key factors in determining their overall energy efficiency and carbon footprint.
