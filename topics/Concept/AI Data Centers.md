AI Data Centers are specialized facilities designed to house the servers and infrastructure required to train and operate AI models. These data centers are equipped with high-performance computing hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), and advanced cooling systems to manage the heat generated by AI workloads. The energy consumption of AI data centers is a major concern, as they require substantial amounts of electricity to power their operations. The environmental impact of AI data centers is a growing area of research, as the industry seeks to develop more sustainable and energy-efficient solutions.
