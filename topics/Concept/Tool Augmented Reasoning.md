Tool-Augmented Reasoning involves integrating external tools, APIs, and computation platforms into the reasoning pipeline of AI Agents. This allows agents to access real-time information, execute code, and interact with dynamic data environments. Tool-Augmented Reasoning enhances the functionality of AI Agents by enabling them to perform complex tasks that require external data or computations. It is essential for tasks that involve real-time decision-making, data analysis, and automation.
