The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables. It consists of two main steps: the Expectation step (E-step), where the expected values of the latent variables are computed given the current estimates of the parameters, and the Maximization step (M-step), where the parameters are updated to maximize the likelihood function. The algorithm iterates between these steps until convergence. The algorithm is particularly useful when the data is incomplete or has latent variables.
