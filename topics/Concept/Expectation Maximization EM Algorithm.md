The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative optimization method used for finding maximum likelihood estimates in models with latent variables. It alternates between an Expectation (E) step, where the expected values of the latent variables are computed given the current estimates of the parameters, and a Maximization (M) step, where the parameters are updated to maximize the expected log-likelihood. The EM algorithm is particularly useful for handling missing data and is applied in various statistical and machine learning models. In the context of Probabilistic Chess, the EM algorithm is used to calculate the expected value of moves by considering the probabilities of success and failure. This involves computing the score if a move succeeds and the score if it fails, then combining these scores weighted by their respective probabilities to determine the best move. This approach allows the AI to make decisions that account for the probabilistic nature of the game.
