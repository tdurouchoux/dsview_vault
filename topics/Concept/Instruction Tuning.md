Instruction tuning is a technique used to align large language models with human intentions by fine-tuning them on datasets that consist of instructions and desired outputs. This process helps models better understand and follow specific commands, improving their performance on a wide range of tasks. Instruction tuning is crucial for making language models more versatile and useful in practical applications.
