Instruction Tuning is a process where language models are fine-tuned on datasets that consist of instructions and corresponding responses. This helps the models to better understand and follow complex instructions, improving their performance on a wide range of tasks. Instruction tuning can involve generating high-quality, diverse instructions to enhance the model's ability to handle various types of queries and commands.
