A mode of operation for coding agents where the agent performs actions without seeking user confirmation for each step. This mode is named after the phrase "You Only Live Once," reflecting the higher risk and potential for significant actions or mistakes. It is often used in asynchronous coding agents to enhance efficiency but comes with inherent security risks.
