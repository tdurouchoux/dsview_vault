Frequentist statistics is a framework for statistical inference that focuses on the frequency of events under repeated sampling. It relies on fixed parameters and uses data to make inferences about these parameters. Frequentist methods include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and p-values, which are based on the assumption that the data are generated by a probability model with fixed but unknown parameters.
