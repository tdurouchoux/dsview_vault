CALRec is a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained LLM for sequential recommendations. It converts all input into text sequences and uses a combination of next-item generation tasks and auxiliary contrastive alignment to improve recommendation accuracy. CALRec aims to leverage the strengths of LLMs in understanding and generating textual data to enhance recommendation systems.
