Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a predefined manner. This type of data can include text documents, emails, social media posts, images, videos, and more. Unstructured data is often challenging to analyze and process due to its lack of structure, but it can provide valuable insights when properly managed and analyzed. Various tools and techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning, can be used to extract meaningful information from unstructured data.
