Selective disclosure in AI model evaluations refers to the practice where providers can choose which model performance results to publicly release, often opting to disclose only the best-performing variants. This practice can distort leaderboard rankings by allowing providers to present only their most favorable outcomes, thereby creating an illusion of superior performance. It highlights the need for transparent and comprehensive reporting of all model evaluations to ensure fairness and reliability in AI model assessments.
