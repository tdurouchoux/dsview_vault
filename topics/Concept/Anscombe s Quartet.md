Anscombe's Quartet is a collection of four datasets that have similar statistical properties but appear very different when graphed. This concept is used to illustrate the importance of visualizing data to understand its underlying patterns and to avoid relying solely on summary statistics. The quartet demonstrates how different types of relationships within data can result in the same correlation coefficient, highlighting the necessity of plotting data to discern meaningful patterns and potential outliers.
