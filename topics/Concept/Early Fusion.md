Early fusion is a technique used in multimodal models to integrate different types of data, such as text, images and audio, into a unified model backbone during the pre-training phase. This approach enables the model to learn joint representations of the different modalities, improving its performance on tasks that require understanding and processing multiple types of input data simultaneously.
