Density-Based Methods are a class of anomaly detection techniques that identify anomalies based on the density of data points in a given region. These methods assume that anomalies are points that are in low-density regions, while normal points are in high-density regions. Common density-based methods include DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) and LOF (Local Outlier Factor). These methods are effective in identifying clusters of normal data points and detecting anomalies that deviate from these clusters. Density-based methods are particularly useful in applications where the data distribution is complex and non-linear, such as image processing, bioinformatics, and environmental monitoring.
