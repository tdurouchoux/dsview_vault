A p-value is a measure used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the probability of observing the sample data, or more extreme data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It helps in assessing whether the observed data is statistically significant. A low p-value indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the observed effect is unlikely to be due to random chance. The interpretation of p-values depends on the chosen significance level (alpha), typically set at 0.05.
