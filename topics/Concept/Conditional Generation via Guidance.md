Conditional Generation via Guidance is a technique used with diffusion models to generate data conditioned on specific inputs or constraints. This approach allows the model to generate data that adheres to given conditions, such as text prompts for image generation. By incorporating guidance, diffusion models can produce more controlled and targeted outputs, enhancing their versatility and applicability in various generative tasks.
