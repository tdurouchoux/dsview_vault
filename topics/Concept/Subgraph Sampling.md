Subgraph sampling is a crucial process in GNN training where small, tractable subgraphs are sampled from a larger graph to create input examples for GNN training. This process can be dynamic or batch-based, and it is essential for scaling GNN training to large datasets. TF-GNN provides tooling for both dynamic and batch subgraph sampling at various scales.
