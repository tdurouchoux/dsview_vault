A violin plot is a method of plotting numeric data and can be used to visualize the distribution of the data. It is similar to a box plot, but it also shows the probability density of the data at different values. In the provided source text, the use of violin plots for small sample sizes is criticized. The text explains that distributions and quartiles can vary widely with small sample sizes, making violin plots ineffective for small datasets.
