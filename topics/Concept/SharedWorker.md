SharedWorker is a type of web worker in browsers that can be accessed from multiple browsing contexts (like windows, iframes, etc.) at the same time. It allows different parts of a web application to share a single background thread, which can be useful for resource-intensive tasks that need to be shared across multiple parts of an application.
