Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as updating data, creating and modifying database schemas, and controlling access to data. SQL has been in use for over 50 years and remains a fundamental tool in database management despite its age and various attempts to replace it.
