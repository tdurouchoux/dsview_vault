RapidResponseBench is a benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid response techniques in mitigating jailbreak attacks on large language models (LLMs). It measures the robustness of defensive methods against various jailbreaking strategies after adapting to a few observed examples. The benchmark includes in-distribution and out-of-distribution attack variants, as well as metrics for attack success rate and refusal rate on benign queries.
