A declarative data stack is a set of tools and configurations that can be thought of as a single function to recreate the entire data stack. It focuses on defining what you want rather than specifying each step, abstracting away implementation details and focusing on outcomes. This approach manages complexity in a simple interface, making it suitable for non-technical users and ensuring a consistent, reproducible data platform across diverse components. It cleanly separates semantics from implementation, decoupling business logic from technical details, and allows for a stateless stack that can be recreated from scratch with its configuration.
