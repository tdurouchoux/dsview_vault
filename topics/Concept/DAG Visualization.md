DAG Visualization refers to the graphical representation of a DAG in Airflow, which helps in understanding the structure and flow of tasks within the DAG. Airflow provides two main options for DAG visualization: the Graph view in the Airflow UI and the airflow dags show command, which renders the DAG as an image file. DAG Visualization is crucial for monitoring and debugging workflows.
