Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images, making them highly effective for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
