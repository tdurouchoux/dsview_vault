Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. In the context of machine learning, it is often used to update the prior probability of a class to the posterior probability given new data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the class distribution in the training data differs from the class distribution in the real-world application.
