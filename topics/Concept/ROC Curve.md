The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is created by plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity) at various threshold settings. The area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) provides a single scalar value that represents the overall performance of the classifier.
