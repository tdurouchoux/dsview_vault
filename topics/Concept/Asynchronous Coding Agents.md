A type of coding agent that can be prompted and left to work on a problem independently, filing a pull request once the task is completed. These agents are particularly useful for running multiple tasks simultaneously and are often used in web-based environments like Claude Code for web and Codex Cloud. They help mitigate security concerns associated with running arbitrary code execution on personal devices.
