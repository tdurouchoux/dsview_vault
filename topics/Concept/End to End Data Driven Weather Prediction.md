End-to-end data-driven weather prediction refers to the use of machine learning models to replace traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. This approach aims to improve the speed and accuracy of weather forecasts by leveraging neural networks to process observational data directly, without relying on complex numerical solvers. The goal is to create a more efficient and accurate forecasting system that can be easily customized and optimized for specific tasks.
