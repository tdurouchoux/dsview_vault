A UI widget that I call a natural slider. Often when opening a new graph, or testing a new version of the engine, or adding a new parameter, it's impossible to know ahead of time what a sensible range for the value should be, even to an order of magnitude. Not to worry! With the natural slider, you can dynamically adjust the range by powers of e. This gives us natural orders that fit our intuitive sense of bigger and smaller while giving easy access to the entire range of positive floats. Powers of 2 are too small, powers of ten are too big.
