Swarm is an educational framework designed for lightweight, ergonomic multi-agent orchestration. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage interactions between multiple agents, allowing for easy coordination and execution of tasks. Swarm is particularly useful for exploring patterns in multi-agent systems, offering developers a tool to build scalable solutions without a steep learning curve. It is managed by the OpenAI Solutions team and is powered by the Chat Completions API, making it stateless between calls.
