NanoGraphRAG is a lightweight implementation of the GraphRAG indexing pipeline designed for straightforward integration with Kotaemon. It aims to provide a simpler and more efficient way to implement graph-based retrieval in RAG systems. NanoGraphRAG is particularly useful for users who want to enhance their RAG pipelines with graph-based retrieval without the complexity of full GraphRAG implementation.
