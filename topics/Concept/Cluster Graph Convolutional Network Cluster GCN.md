Cluster-GCN is an extension of the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) algorithm designed to scale to larger graphs and train deeper GCN models using Stochastic Gradient Descent. It improves the efficiency of GCN by clustering nodes and performing convolution operations within these clusters, which reduces the computational complexity and memory usage. Cluster-GCN supports representation learning and node classification for homogeneous graphs and is particularly useful for large-scale graph data.
