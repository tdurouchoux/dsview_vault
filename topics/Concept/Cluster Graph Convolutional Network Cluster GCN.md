Cluster-GCN is an extension of the GCN algorithm designed to scale to larger graphs and train deeper GCN models using Stochastic Gradient Descent. It supports representation learning and node classification for homogeneous graphs. Cluster-GCN improves the efficiency of GCN by clustering nodes and performing convolution operations within these clusters, which reduces computational complexity and memory usage.
