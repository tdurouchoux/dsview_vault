Overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics occurs when models are optimized for performance on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard rather than general model quality. This overfitting is driven by the ability to access and leverage Arena data, which can result in significant performance gains on Arena-specific tasks but may not translate to broader generalization.
