Evaluation metrics are standards or criteria used to measure the performance, quality, or effectiveness of a system, model, or process. In the context of AI and machine learning, evaluation metrics are used to assess how well a model performs on a given task, such as text generation, translation, summarization, or classification. These metrics can be quantitative or qualitative, and they help in comparing different models, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the model meets the desired standards.
