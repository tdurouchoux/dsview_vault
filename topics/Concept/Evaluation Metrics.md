Evaluation metrics are standards or criteria used to measure the performance, quality, or effectiveness of a system, model, or process. In the context of AI and machine learning, evaluation metrics are used to assess how well a model performs on a given task. These metrics can be quantitative or qualitative and are essential for comparing different models, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring that the model meets the desired standards. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error, among others. The choice of metric depends on the specific task and the goals of the evaluation.
