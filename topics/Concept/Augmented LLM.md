An augmented LLM refers to a large language model enhanced with additional capabilities such as retrieval, tools, and memory. These augmentations allow the LLM to generate search queries, select appropriate tools, and retain relevant information, thereby improving its ability to perform complex tasks. The Model Context Protocol is an example of a framework that facilitates the integration of these capabilities with third-party tools.
