Temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning refers to the ability of an agent to reason over longer time scales and break down complex tasks into manageable sub-goals. This is achieved through concepts like options and inter/intra-option learning, which allow agents to plan and act at different levels of temporal granularity. Temporal abstraction helps agents handle tasks that require long-term planning and sequential decision-making.
