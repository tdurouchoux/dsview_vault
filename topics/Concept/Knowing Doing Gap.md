The knowing-doing gap refers to the discrepancy between a model's ability to know how to solve a task and its ability to act on this knowledge. This gap has been observed in large language models (LLMs) where models can possess knowledge about a task or describe the consequences of their behavior but fail to materialize this knowledge when acting. The knowing-doing gap is a significant obstacle towards more powerful agentic LLMs.
