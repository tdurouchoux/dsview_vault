Function-calling in the context of AI agents refers to the ability of an agent to call specific functions or APIs to perform tasks or retrieve information. This involves the agent identifying the need for a particular function, invoking it with the appropriate parameters, and using the returned data to continue its operations or generate responses. Function calling is the process of invoking tools or functions that an AI agent can use to perform specific actions. Many model providers support tool use through function calling, where tools are declared with their parameters and documentation. The agent generates the appropriate tool calls and parameters based on the user query, which are then executed to accomplish the task. Function calling in the context of generative AI refers to the ability of an AI model to invoke external functions or APIs to perform specific tasks. This technique allows the model to interact with external systems, retrieve additional information, or execute actions that are beyond its inherent capabilities. Function calling enhances the functionality and versatility of AI applications by enabling them to integrate with other services and systems seamlessly.
