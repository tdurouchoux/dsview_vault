Tamper-proof, cryptographically-signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable proof of a user's instructions. Mandates are used in AP2 to establish trust and provide a secure, unchangeable record of transactions. They come in two forms: Intent Mandates (for real-time purchases) and Cart Mandates (for delegated tasks), ensuring authorization, authenticity, and accountability in transactions.
