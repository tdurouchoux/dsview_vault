Naive RAG represents the earliest methodology in the development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It involves a straightforward process of indexing, retrieval, and generation. In the indexing phase, data is cleaned, converted into plain text, and divided into smaller chunks. These chunks are then encoded into vectors and stored in an index for quick retrieval. During the retrieval phase, a user's input is encoded into a vector, and the similarity between this vector and the document blocks in the corpus is calculated to retrieve the top K relevant documents. In the generation phase, the retrieved documents are combined with the user's question to form a new prompt, which the large language model uses to generate an answer. Despite its simplicity, Naive RAG faces several challenges, including low precision and recall in retrieval, outdated information, and issues with response generation quality such as hallucination and irrelevance.
