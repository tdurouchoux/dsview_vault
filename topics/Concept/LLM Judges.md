LLM judges are advanced language models used to evaluate the responses of other LLMs. In the context of FACTS Grounding, judges like Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet assess the factual accuracy and grounding of LLM responses. These judges help ensure that the evaluated models provide responses that are fully attributable to the provided documents.
