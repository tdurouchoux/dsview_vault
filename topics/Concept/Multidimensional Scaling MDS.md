Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) is a technique used in dimensionality reduction to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving the pairwise distances between points. It involves converting a distance matrix into a Gram matrix through double centering and then performing an eigen-decomposition to find the low-dimensional coordinates. MDS is particularly useful for visualizing and interpreting complex data sets by capturing the intrinsic structure of the data.
