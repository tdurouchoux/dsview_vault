A method for dividing text into chunks based on contextual information. It aims to create meaningful and coherent chunks that preserve the context and relationships within the text. This technique is used to handle token-limit constraints in large language models (LLMs) and to improve the efficiency of data processing. Chunking methods can vary, including splitting by document, page, length, section, keyword, semantic content, or using AI agents to identify meaningful sections. Effective chunking ensures that data is processed in a way that maintains context and relevance.
