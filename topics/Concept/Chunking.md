Chunking is a natural language processing technique that involves breaking down a text into smaller, meaningful units or chunks. These chunks typically consist of words or phrases that convey a specific idea or concept within the context of the text. Chunking helps organize and structure information, making it easier for models to analyze and understand the content.
