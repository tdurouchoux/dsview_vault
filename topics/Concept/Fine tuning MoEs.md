Fine-tuning Mixture of Experts (MoE) models involves adjusting the model parameters to improve performance on specific tasks. This process can be challenging due to the sparse nature of MoEs, which are prone to overfitting. Techniques such as higher regularization, adjusting auxiliary loss, and freezing certain layers are employed to enhance fine-tuning effectiveness and prevent overfitting.
