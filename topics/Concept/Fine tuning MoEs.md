Fine-tuning Mixture of Experts (MoEs) involves adapting a pre-trained MoE model to a specific task or dataset. This process can be challenging due to the unique characteristics of MoE models, such as their sparse architecture and the use of a gating network to route tokens to experts. Fine-tuning MoEs may require adjusting hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and batch size, to account for the model's sparsity and the different dynamics of fine-tuning compared to dense models. Additionally, techniques such as freezing certain layers or using auxiliary loss functions can help improve the fine-tuning process and prevent overfitting.
