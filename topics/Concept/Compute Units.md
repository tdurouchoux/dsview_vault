Compute units are a measure of computational resources consumed by certain operations, such as running the prompt() function with LLMs. They help in quantifying and managing the cost and performance of these operations. In the context of MotherDuck, compute units are used to limit and monitor the usage of the prompt() function, ensuring efficient and cost-effective utilization of computational resources.
