Agentic architecture refers to a design where an agent can reason over data, call tools, and decide where to dig deeper instead of following a fixed sequence of steps. This approach allows for more dynamic and adaptive behavior, enabling the agent to pull in additional context as needed at runtime. It also facilitates richer experimentation and iteration on the toolset, significantly impacting outcomes.
