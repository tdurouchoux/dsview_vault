LLM systems that can write, execute, and iterate on code, often integrated with tools to perform complex tasks. These agents can operate in loops to achieve goals, making them highly useful for coding and search tasks. Examples include Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Gemini CLI, which allow for both synchronous and asynchronous coding tasks.
