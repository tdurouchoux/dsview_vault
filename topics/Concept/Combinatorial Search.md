Combinatorial search is a method used in program synthesis where a machine searches through a space of possible programs by trying different combinations of logical operators. This approach is data-efficient but computationally intensive due to combinatorial explosion. It is used to solve tasks in the ARC benchmark by synthesizing new solution programs on the fly, making it a key technique in the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI).
