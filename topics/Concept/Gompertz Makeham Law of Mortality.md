The Gompertz-Makeham Law of Mortality is a statistical model used to describe the age-specific mortality rates in human populations. The model consists of two components: the Gompertz part, which represents the age-dependent risk of death from diseases, and the Makeham part, which represents the age-independent risk of death from external causes such as accidents and violence. This law helps to explain the characteristic hook-shaped pattern observed in death rates across different ages, with risks declining steeply after infancy, rising suddenly in adolescence, and then rising gradually and exponentially with age.
