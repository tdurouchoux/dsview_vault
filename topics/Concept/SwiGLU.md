SwiGLU (Gated Linear Unit) is an activation function used in neural networks, particularly in transformer models. It combines the benefits of the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) with a switch mechanism, allowing the model to dynamically control the flow of information. This can lead to improved performance and efficiency in tasks involving complex data.
