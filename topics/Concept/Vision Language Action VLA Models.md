Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advanced AI systems that integrate visual information, language understanding, and action execution. These models enable robots to interpret instructions, plan actions, and perform tasks in the physical world. VLA models are designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks by translating high-level instructions into specific motor commands, making robots more capable and versatile.
