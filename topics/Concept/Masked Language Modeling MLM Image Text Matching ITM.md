MLM and ITM are pre-training objectives used to align specific parts of images with text. MLM predicts masked words in a caption based on the corresponding image, while ITM predicts whether a caption matches an image. Models like VisualBERT, FLAVA, ViLBERT, LXMERT, and BridgeTower use these objectives for tasks such as visual question answering and text-based image retrieval.
