Masked-Language Modeling (MLM) and Image-Text Matching (ITM) are pre-training objectives used in vision-language models. MLM involves predicting masked words in a caption based on the corresponding image, while ITM involves predicting whether a caption matches an image. These objectives enable tasks such as visual question answering, text-based image retrieval, and text-guided object detection.
