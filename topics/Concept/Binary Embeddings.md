Binary embeddings are a type of embedding where text or other data is converted into binary vectors. These embeddings are particularly useful for fast computations, such as Hamming distance calculations, which are efficient and can be performed quickly even on resource-constrained hardware. Binary embeddings are often used in applications requiring rapid similarity searches or clustering tasks.
