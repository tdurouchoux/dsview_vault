UltraFeedback is a feedback mechanism used to improve the performance and alignment of language models. It involves collecting and utilizing feedback data to fine-tune models, ensuring they better meet user needs and preferences. In the context of SmolLM2, UltraFeedback was used in conjunction with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enhance the model's instruction-following capabilities and overall performance.
