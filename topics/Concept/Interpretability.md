Interpretability in the context of large language models (LLMs) refers to the ability to understand and explain the inner workings of these models. Techniques like mechanistic interpretability and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to provide insights into how LLMs process information and make predictions. Interpretability is crucial for identifying and modifying specific behaviors of models, such as through abliteration, which allows for the adjustment of model outputs without extensive retraining. This field is essential for improving model transparency and trustworthiness.
