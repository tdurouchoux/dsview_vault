Greediness in decision-making refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to overly favor the best performing action among a small set of actions seen so far. This behavior leads to stagnating action coverage and sub-optimal exploration, resulting in sub-optimal decision-making performance. Greediness is one of the prevalent failure modes observed in LLMs when faced with decision-making scenarios.
