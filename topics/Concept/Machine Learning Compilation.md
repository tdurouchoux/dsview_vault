Machine Learning Compilation is the process of converting a machine learning model from one representation to another, often to improve performance or portability. This can involve optimizing the model's computation graph, converting it to a different format, or generating code for a specific hardware platform. Machine learning compilation is a complex and challenging task due to the large and diverse set of operations used in deep learning models, as well as the need to maintain the model's accuracy and functionality during the conversion process.
