A virtual environment is an isolated environment on a computer that allows developers to install and manage dependencies for a specific project separately from the system-wide Python installation. This helps in avoiding conflicts between different projects that might rely on different versions of the same libraries. Virtual environments are particularly useful in data science and machine learning projects, where different projects might require different versions of libraries or tools.
