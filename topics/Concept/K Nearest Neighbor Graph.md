A K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph is a type of graph where each point is connected to its k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric, typically Euclidean distance. This graph structure is used in various machine learning and data analysis tasks, including dimensionality reduction techniques like Isomap, t-SNE, and UMAP. The KNN graph captures the local similarity structure of the data, which is crucial for preserving the intrinsic geometry of the data in lower-dimensional embeddings.
