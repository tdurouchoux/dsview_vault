Self-Play is a technique where a language model engages in a form of interactive training by generating and responding to its own prompts. This involves the model creating scenarios, playing different roles, and learning from the interactions. Self-play helps in improving the model's ability to handle complex conversations, understand context, and generate more accurate and relevant responses.
