Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is a training objective used in language models to enhance performance by predicting multiple tokens simultaneously. This approach can improve the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. MTP can also be used for speculative decoding, which accelerates the inference process by predicting multiple tokens ahead of time.
