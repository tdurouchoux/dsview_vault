Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) is a training objective introduced in the DeepSeek-V3 model to enhance performance. It involves predicting multiple tokens simultaneously, which can also be used for speculative decoding to accelerate inference. This approach aims to improve the model's predictive accuracy and efficiency during the generation of text.
