Graph pattern matching is the process of identifying occurrences of a given graph pattern within a larger graph. It is a fundamental operation in graph databases and is used in various applications, including query processing, data integration, and anomaly detection. Graph pattern matching algorithms are designed to efficiently search for and identify specific subgraphs within a larger graph structure.
