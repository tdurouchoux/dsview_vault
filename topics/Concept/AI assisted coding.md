AI-assisted coding refers to the use of artificial intelligence tools to aid in the software development process. These tools can generate code, suggest completions, refactor code, and assist in debugging. They are designed to accelerate development by automating routine tasks and providing intelligent suggestions based on vast amounts of training data. AI-assisted coding tools can range from simple code completion features to more advanced systems that can generate entire functions or modules based on natural language descriptions.
