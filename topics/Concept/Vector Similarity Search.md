Vector similarity search is a technique used to find vectors in a database that are similar to a given query vector. This is typically measured using distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Vector similarity search is crucial for applications such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and image recognition, where the goal is to retrieve items that are semantically or contextually similar to the query.
