Vector embeddings are high-dimensional representations of data, such as text or images, that capture semantic meanings in a numerical format. These embeddings are generated using models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small, E5, BGE, and Solon and are used in various AI applications for tasks like semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), semantic similarity, information retrieval, and text clustering.
