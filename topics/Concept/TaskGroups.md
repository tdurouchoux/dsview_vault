TaskGroups in Airflow are used to organize tasks into hierarchical groups within a DAG. They help to reduce visual clutter in the DAG graph view and make it easier to manage and understand complex workflows. TaskGroups allow for the grouping of related tasks, and dependencies can be applied across all tasks within a group.
