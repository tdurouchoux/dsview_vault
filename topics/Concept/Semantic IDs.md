Semantic IDs are content-derived features used as substitutes for traditional hash-based IDs in recommendation systems. They are generated through a transformer-based video encoder and compressed into discrete Semantic IDs using a Residual Quantization Variational AutoEncoder (RQ-VAE). This approach aims to improve efficiency and performance, especially in cold-start scenarios, by representing user histories with compact semantic IDs instead of high-dimensional embeddings.
