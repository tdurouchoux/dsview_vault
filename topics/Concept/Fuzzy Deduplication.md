Fuzzy Deduplication is the process of identifying and removing duplicate or near-duplicate texts based on a similarity threshold. This technique is useful for tasks like data cleaning, information retrieval, and text clustering, where the presence of duplicate texts can affect the accuracy and efficiency of the results. Fuzzy Deduplication uses similarity measures to compare texts and remove those that are below a certain threshold, ensuring that the remaining texts are unique and relevant. This process is crucial for ensuring high-quality data, especially in the context of training Large Language Models (LLMs). It helps in avoiding performance overestimation, wasted compute, and overestimation of feature importance by removing duplicates from training sets.
