Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a concept in AI where agents are designed to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base or dataset and use this information to generate responses or perform tasks. This approach combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to enhance the accuracy and context-awareness of AI agents.
