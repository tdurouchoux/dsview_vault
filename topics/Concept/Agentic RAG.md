Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based and generative models to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated text. In Agentic RAG, AI agents are used to dynamically retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base or database and incorporate this information into the generation process. This approach enhances the ability of AI systems to provide contextually appropriate and informative responses, making it particularly useful in applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and content generation.
