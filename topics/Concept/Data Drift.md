Data drift refers to the phenomenon where the statistical properties of input data for a machine learning model change over time, which can degrade model performance. It is a critical aspect of model monitoring in production environments. Data drift can occur due to various factors, such as changes in user behavior, data collection processes, or external factors affecting the data generation process. Detecting and addressing data drift is essential for maintaining model accuracy and reliability. Tools like Skyulf provide automated drift detection features that compare production data against training baselines to identify and mitigate data drift issues.
