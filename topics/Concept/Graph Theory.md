Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and applications of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to represent a wide variety of data types, including social networks, molecular structures, and citation networks. They can be directed or undirected, and can include additional attributes such as node features, edge weights, and global graph properties. Understanding graph structure is fundamental in graph theory and network analysis, as it provides the foundation for various algorithms and methods used to analyze and learn from graph data.
