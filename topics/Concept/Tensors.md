Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that are fundamental data structures in PyTorch. They are used to store and manipulate data, perform mathematical operations, and handle gradients, which are crucial for training machine learning models. Tensors can hold various data types and structures, such as scalars, vectors, and matrices.
