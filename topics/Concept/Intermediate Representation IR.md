Intermediate Representation (IR) is a key concept in compiler design, serving as a bridge between the high-level source code and the low-level machine code. In the context of machine learning, IR refers to a standardized form that models are converted into, allowing for optimization and execution across different hardware platforms. IRs are designed to be rich enough to represent a wide range of operations from various high-level frameworks, yet simple enough to be efficiently supported by different backends.
