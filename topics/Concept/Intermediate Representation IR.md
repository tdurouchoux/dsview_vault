Intermediate Representation (IR) is a key concept in compiler design, referring to a data structure or code format that is used internally by a compiler to represent the source code in a form that is easier to analyze and transform. In the context of machine learning, IRs are used to represent computation graphs in a way that can be optimized and converted to different hardware platforms. IRs can vary in complexity and abstraction level, with some being more general-purpose and others being more specialized for specific types of operations or hardware.
