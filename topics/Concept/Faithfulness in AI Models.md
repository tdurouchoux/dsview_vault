Faithfulness in AI models refers to the accuracy with which the model's explained reasoning (such as in a Chain-of-Thought) reflects its actual reasoning process. A faithful model would truthfully report the factors and steps it considered in arriving at a decision. Low faithfulness means the model might hide, misrepresent, or omit important aspects of its reasoning, which can be problematic for monitoring and aligning the model's behavior with human intentions.
