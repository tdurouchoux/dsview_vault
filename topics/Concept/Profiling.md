Profiling involves analyzing the performance of your code to identify bottlenecks and areas that can be optimized. Python provides built-in tools and external libraries for profiling, helping developers gain insights into their code's execution time and resource usage. Profiling allows you to pinpoint sections of your code that consume the most time and resources, aiding in optimization efforts.
