Reasoning models are specialized large language models (LLMs) designed to excel at complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning. These models are refined to handle tasks such as solving puzzles, advanced math problems, and coding challenges by generating intermediate steps in their responses. They are particularly useful for tasks that require a detailed thought process, although they may be more expensive and prone to overthinking compared to standard LLMs.
