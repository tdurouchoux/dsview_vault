HinSAGE is an extension of the GraphSAGE algorithm designed for heterogeneous networks. It supports representation learning, node classification/regression, and link prediction/regression for graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges. HinSAGE uses mean aggregation of neighbor nodes, taking into account their types and the types of links between them. This makes it suitable for complex networks where nodes and edges have different attributes and relationships.
