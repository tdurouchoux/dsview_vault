HinSAGE is an extension of the GraphSAGE algorithm designed for heterogeneous networks. It supports representation learning, node classification, and link prediction for graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges. HinSAGE takes into account the types of nodes and the relationships between them, using mean aggregation of neighbor nodes to generate embeddings. This makes it particularly useful for complex networks where nodes and edges have different attributes and relationships, such as knowledge graphs or social networks with various entity types.
