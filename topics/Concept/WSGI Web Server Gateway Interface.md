WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification for a simple and universal interface between web servers and Python web applications. It is designed to promote web application portability across a variety of web servers and to simplify the task of writing web servers and application frameworks. WSGI allows Python web applications to be deployed in a standardized way, making it easier to switch between different web servers and frameworks. The specification defines a simple callable interface that web servers can use to invoke applications and a set of variables that the server and application can use to communicate with each other.
