AI regulation refers to the set of rules and guidelines designed to govern the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence technologies. This includes frameworks like the EU's AI Act, which aims to ensure that AI systems are safe, transparent, and accountable. The regulation often addresses issues such as bias, privacy, and the ethical use of AI, and may require companies to disclose information about their AI models to ensure compliance and mitigate risks.
