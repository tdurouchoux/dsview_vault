Prompt Engineering is a systematic approach to improving prompts for language models, closing the intent-instruction gap through measurement and testing on real data. It involves using tools like DSPy and promptim to automate and optimize the prompt engineering process. This can include techniques such as few-shot learning, where the model is provided with a few examples of the desired input-output pairs, and chain-of-thought prompting, where the model is encouraged to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.
