Self-Rewarding is a technique where a language model evaluates and rewards its own outputs based on predefined criteria. This involves the model generating responses, assessing their quality, and providing rewards or feedback to improve future outputs. Self-rewarding helps in fine-tuning the model to generate higher-quality responses and align better with user intentions and ethical guidelines.
