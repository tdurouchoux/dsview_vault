Advanced f-string String Formatting in Python allows developers to interpolate variables, objects, and expressions into strings with greater control and flexibility. Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings support a format mini-language that enables number formatting, string padding, date formatting, and more. This feature enhances string manipulation capabilities, making it easier to create formatted strings with minimal code.
