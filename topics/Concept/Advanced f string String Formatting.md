Advanced f-string String Formatting in Python allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}` to evaluate expressions at runtime. This feature provides a concise and readable way to format strings, making it easier to combine variables, expressions, and literals in a single string. Advanced f-string formatting includes features like string alignment, number formatting, and conditional expressions, making it a powerful tool for string manipulation.
