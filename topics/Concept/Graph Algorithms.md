Graph algorithms are methods designed to operate on graph data structures. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as finding the shortest path between nodes, detecting communities within a network, or calculating the centrality of nodes. Graph algorithms are fundamental in fields like computer science, operations research, and network analysis.
