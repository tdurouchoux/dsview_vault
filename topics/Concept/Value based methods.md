Value-based methods in reinforcement learning involve estimating the value of taking specific actions in given states to determine the optimal policy. These methods focus on learning a value function that assigns a value to each state (or state-action pair), which can then be used to derive the policy. Common algorithms include Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
