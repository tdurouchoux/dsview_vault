Governance-as-a-Service is a facilitating body that ensures the successful implementation and adoption of data contracts within an organization. This approach focuses on making the 'virtuous path' easier than workarounds, addressing operational needs, facilitating collaboration between producers and consumers, and promoting accountability. It works on two key axes: organizational strategy and operational processes, to demonstrate the value of contracts and integrate them into business and tech teams' workflows.
