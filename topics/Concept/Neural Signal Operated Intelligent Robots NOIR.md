Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR) is a system designed to control robots through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. It allows users to perform complex tasks by breaking them down into simple thoughts, such as selecting an object, choosing an action, and specifying a location on the object. This system uses EEG signals to interpret user intentions and translate them into robot actions, enabling tasks like ironing clothes or making a sandwich.
