Multimodal diagnostic dialogue refers to the process of conducting medical diagnostic conversations that incorporate various types of data, such as text, images, and documents. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition by integrating different types of information. In the context of AMIE, multimodal diagnostic dialogue enables the AI agent to request, interpret, and reason about visual medical information, enhancing its ability to provide accurate diagnoses and management plans.
