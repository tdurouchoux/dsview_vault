Robotic Process Automation (RPA) involves using software robots or artificial intelligence (AI) workers to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that would otherwise be performed by a human being. These tasks can include queries, calculations, and maintenance of records and transactions. RPA is used to automate data entry, processing, and other routine tasks, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
