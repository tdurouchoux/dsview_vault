Logarithmic loss (log loss) is a performance metric for classification models that penalizes false classifications. It measures the uncertainty between the predicted probability and the actual label. Lower log loss indicates better performance, with the best possible score being 0, which occurs when the model is perfectly confident in the correct class.
