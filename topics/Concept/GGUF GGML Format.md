GGUF (GGML Format) is a file format used for storing and deploying machine learning models, particularly those based on the GGML (General Matrix Multiplication Language) framework. This format is designed to be efficient and compatible with various hardware platforms, making it easier to deploy models locally or on edge devices. GGUF (Guanine-Guanine-Uracil-Furan) is a format used for quantized models, particularly large language models. It allows for efficient storage and execution of these models by reducing their size through quantization techniques. GGUF models can be easily integrated and run using applications like Ollama, providing flexibility in choosing different quantization schemes and templates for interaction.
