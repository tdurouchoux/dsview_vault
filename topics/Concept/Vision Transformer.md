A vision transformer is a type of deep learning model that applies the transformer architecture, originally developed for natural language processing, to computer vision tasks. It processes images by dividing them into patches, which are then linearly embedded and fed into a transformer encoder. Vision transformers have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and weather forecasting. They are particularly effective at capturing long-range dependencies in data and handling high-dimensional inputs.
