Pseudocode is an informal high-level description of the steps in an algorithm or a program. It uses the structural conventions of programming languages but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. In the context of InstructPipe, pseudocode is used to represent machine learning pipelines in a compact and interpretable format.
