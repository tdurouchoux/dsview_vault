Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable representation of code that outlines the structure and logic of a program without the syntax of a specific programming language. In the context of InstructPipe, pseudocode is used to define the selections and connections of essential nodes in a visual programming pipeline, making it easier to generate and interpret complex workflows.
