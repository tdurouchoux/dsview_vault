LASSO is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It is particularly useful in situations where the number of predictors is large compared to the number of observations. LASSO adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients of the predictors, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a simpler model.
