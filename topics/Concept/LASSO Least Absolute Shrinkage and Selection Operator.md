LASSO is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the number of features is large compared to the number of observations. LASSO adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients of the features, which can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a simpler model by reducing the number of features used.
