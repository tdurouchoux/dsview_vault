Evolutionary optimization is an algorithm that operates in 'generations', applying semi-random 'mutations' to create candidate prompts. The best-performing prompts are retained after each generation. This technique combines direct 'text gradient' approaches with more 'global' updates to overcome local optima and explore variations across the prompt population, aiming for a more globally optimal solution.
