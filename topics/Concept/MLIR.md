MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a flexible and extensible compiler infrastructure developed by Google for representing and transforming programs in a modular and efficient manner. It provides a framework for defining custom dialects, which are domain-specific languages that can be used to represent different types of computations. MLIR is designed to support a wide range of applications, from high-level machine learning models to low-level hardware-specific optimizations, making it a versatile tool for compiler developers.
