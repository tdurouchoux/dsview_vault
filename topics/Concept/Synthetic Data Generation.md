Synthetic Data Generation refers to the process of creating artificial data that mimics real-world data. This is particularly useful in scenarios where real data is scarce, expensive to obtain, or privacy-sensitive. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), synthetic data generation involves creating text data that can be used to train, fine-tune, or evaluate these models. This can include generating synthetic instructions, code, mathematical problems, and more, to enhance the performance and capabilities of LLMs. They allow to maintain the confidentiality of data while offering a realistic alternative for analysis and modeling. Synthetic training data refers to artificially created data used to train large language models. This data is designed to help steer models in the right direction and has several advantages over organic data, including structured and gradual learning, making it easier for models to follow reasoning patterns.
