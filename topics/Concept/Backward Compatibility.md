Backward compatibility refers to the ability of a system, such as a software application or data format, to work with older versions of itself or with other systems. In the context of data formats like Parquet, backward compatibility ensures that files written in older versions of the format can still be read by newer versions of the format. This is crucial for maintaining data accessibility and usability over time.
