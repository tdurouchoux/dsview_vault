Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) refers to a set of techniques aimed at fine-tuning pre-trained language models with minimal changes to their original parameters. These methods allow for efficient adaptation of large models to specific tasks, reducing the computational and memory requirements associated with traditional fine-tuning approaches.
