Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, such as LoRA, are methods used to adapt existing models to perform better on specific tasks with minimal resource requirements. These techniques provide high performance returns relative to the resources they consume, making them highly attractive for optimizing model performance.
