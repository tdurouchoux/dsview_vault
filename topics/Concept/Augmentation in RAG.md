Augmentation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves enhancing the model's performance by integrating external knowledge sources. This process can occur at different stages, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. Augmentation methods include the use of unstructured data, structured data, and content generated by large language models (LLMs). The augmentation process can be iterative or adaptive, allowing the model to retrieve and generate information more effectively. Techniques such as iterative retrieval, adaptive retrieval, and the use of various data sources aim to improve the model's ability to handle complex tasks and provide accurate, relevant responses.
