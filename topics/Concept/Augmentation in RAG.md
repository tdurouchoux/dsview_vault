Augmentation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) refers to the process of enhancing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. This augmentation can occur at different stages of the language model training process, including pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. Augmentation methods involve using various data sources such as unstructured data, structured data, and content generated by LLMs. The augmentation process can be iterative or adaptive, aiming to improve the efficiency and relevance of the information retrieved. Techniques such as iterative retrieval, adaptive retrieval, and the integration of new modules like search, memory, and extra generation are employed to enhance the RAG process, making it more effective and reliable in practical applications.
