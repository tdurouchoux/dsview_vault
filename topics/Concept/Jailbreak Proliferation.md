Jailbreak proliferation is a data augmentation technique used to generate additional examples of jailbreak attacks based on observed instances. It involves using a language model to create variants of known jailbreaks, which are then used to train defensive models. This method aims to improve the robustness of language models against a wider range of jailbreaking attempts by simulating various attack scenarios.
