Jailbreak proliferation is a data augmentation technique used to generate additional examples of jailbreak attacks based on observed instances. It involves using a language model to create variations of known jailbreaks, which are then used to improve the robustness of defenses against such attacks. This method is crucial for rapid response techniques that aim to quickly adapt to and mitigate novel jailbreak strategies.
