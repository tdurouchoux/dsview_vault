Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a technique used in software development to replace modules in a running application without requiring a full restart. This approach is particularly useful for improving developer productivity by providing near-instantaneous feedback during development. HMR involves dynamically updating modules in memory, ensuring that changes are reflected immediately, which is crucial for large codebases where traditional hot-reloading methods can be slow.
