Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a technique used in software development to replace modules in a running application without requiring a full restart. This approach is particularly useful for improving developer productivity by providing near-instantaneous feedback during development. HMR works by tracking dependencies between modules and selectively reloading only those modules that have changed, thereby avoiding the overhead of a full process restart. This technique is commonly used in frontend development, particularly in the React ecosystem, and can significantly speed up the development workflow in large codebases.
