Explainable AI (XAI) refers to artificial intelligence that is designed to provide clear explanations of its decisions and actions. The goal of XAI is to create a transparent and interpretable model, making it easier for users to understand why a particular decision was made. This is crucial in fields where the stakes are high, such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where understanding the reasoning behind a model's predictions can be as important as the predictions themselves. Techniques like Shapley values and SHAP are examples of methods used in XAI to achieve this transparency. By making AI systems more interpretable, XAI helps build trust and ensures that the decisions made by AI are fair, accountable, and ethical.
