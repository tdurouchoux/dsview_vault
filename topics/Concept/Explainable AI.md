Explainable AI (XAI) refers to artificial intelligence that is easily understood by humans. In contrast to the "black box" nature of many AI models, XAI provides clear explanations for how decisions are made. This is crucial for building trust, ensuring fairness, and complying with regulations. Techniques like SHAP and Shapley values are key components of XAI, helping to demystify complex models and make their workings transparent.
