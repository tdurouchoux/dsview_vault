Multi-modal QA refers to the ability of a question-answering system to handle and process information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and tables. This approach enables the system to provide more comprehensive and accurate answers by leveraging information from different sources. In the context of Kotaemon, multi-modal QA support allows users to perform question-answering on documents that contain figures and tables, enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the tool.
