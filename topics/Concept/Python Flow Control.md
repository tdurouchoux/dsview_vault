Python flow control statements are used to control the execution flow of a program. They include conditional statements like 'if', 'elif', and 'else', loops like 'for' and 'while', and statements like 'break', 'continue', 'pass', and 'return'. These statements allow for the creation of complex and dynamic programs by controlling the order in which code is executed.
