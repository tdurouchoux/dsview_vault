Python flow control refers to the mechanisms used to control the order in which statements are executed in a Python program. This includes the use of conditional statements like 'if', 'elif', and 'else', as well as loops like 'for' and 'while'. Flow control allows programmers to create decision-making logic and repetitive tasks, making programs more dynamic and efficient.
