The No-Vary-Search proposal is an initiative to improve caching mechanisms by allowing servers to specify that certain URL parameters do not affect the content of the resource. This enables browsers to reuse cached versions of a document that differ only by these parameters, reducing unnecessary downloads and improving performance. This proposal is particularly useful for prefetching and prerendering techniques.
