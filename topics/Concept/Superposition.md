Superposition in the context of AI models refers to the phenomenon where a single neuron or feature in a neural network can represent multiple, often unrelated concepts simultaneously. This makes the internal workings of the model complex and difficult to interpret, as the same neuron might contribute to different tasks or concepts depending on the context. Understanding and managing superposition is crucial for advancing mechanistic interpretability and improving the transparency of AI systems.
