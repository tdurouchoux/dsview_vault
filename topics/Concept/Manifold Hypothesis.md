The manifold hypothesis is a core assumption in machine learning that suggests high-dimensional data often lies on or close to a lower-dimensional manifold. This concept is crucial for dimensionality reduction techniques, as it implies that the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is much lower than the dimensionality of the ambient space, making it easier to compress and visualize the data while preserving its structure.
