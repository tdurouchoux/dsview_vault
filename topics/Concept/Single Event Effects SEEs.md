Single Event Effects (SEEs) are transient or permanent changes in the state of an electronic device caused by a single, high-energy particle striking a sensitive node in the device. SEEs can lead to various types of malfunctions, including bit flips, latch-ups, and permanent damage. In the context of space-based systems, understanding and mitigating SEEs is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of electronic components operating in the radiation environment of space.
