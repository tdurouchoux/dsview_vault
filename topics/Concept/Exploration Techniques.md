Techniques used to encourage exploration in reinforcement learning and large language models. These mechanisms help in overcoming the greediness and frequency bias, leading to more effective decision-making and better performance in complex environments. Effective exploration is crucial for agents to learn optimal policies and improve their performance over time.
