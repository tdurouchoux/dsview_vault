The two steps back pattern describes a common issue encountered when using AI-assisted coding tools. After generating an initial solution, attempts to fix small bugs or make minor adjustments often lead to unintended consequences, such as breaking other parts of the code. This cycle of fixing one issue and creating two more can be particularly challenging for non-experts, as they lack the mental models and experience to understand and resolve the underlying problems effectively. This pattern underscores the need for careful review and testing of AI-generated code to ensure its reliability and maintainability.
