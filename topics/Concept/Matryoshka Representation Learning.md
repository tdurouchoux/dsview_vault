A technique that allows for the truncation of high-dimensional embeddings to scale down to meet desired storage costs. This method enables the use of high-dimensional embeddings while managing storage and computational efficiency, providing flexibility in model size and performance. Matryoshka Representation Learning is particularly useful in resource-constrained environments, where the ability to adjust the model size can significantly impact performance.
