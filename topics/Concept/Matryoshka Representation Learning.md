Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) is a technique that allows for the truncation of high-dimensional embeddings to lower dimensions without significant loss of information. This method enables scaling down embeddings to meet desired storage costs while retaining the essential semantic information, providing flexibility in model size and performance. It is a versatile tool for various applications requiring efficient data representation and different levels of detail and computational resources.
