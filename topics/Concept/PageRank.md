PageRank is an algorithm used to rank the importance of nodes (or vertices) in a directed graph, such as web pages on the internet. It is used by search engines to rank web pages in search results. The algorithm iteratively updates the rank of each node based on the ranks of its neighboring nodes, with a dampening factor applied to the ranks to account for the probability of a user continuing to click on links.
