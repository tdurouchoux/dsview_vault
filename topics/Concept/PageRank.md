PageRank is an algorithm used to rank the importance of nodes in a directed graph, such as web pages on the internet. It iteratively updates the rank of each vertex based on the ranks of its incoming neighbors, applying a dampening factor to the ranks. PageRank is widely used in search engines and other applications that require ranking nodes based on their importance within a network.
