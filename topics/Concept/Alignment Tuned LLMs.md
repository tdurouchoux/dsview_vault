Alignment-Tuned LLMs are large language models that have undergone additional training to align their outputs with specific ethical guidelines, safety protocols, or desired behaviors. This tuning process involves fine-tuning the models on datasets that emphasize alignment with human values and intentions, ensuring that the models generate responses that are safe, ethical, and aligned with user expectations.
