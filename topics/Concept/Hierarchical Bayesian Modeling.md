Hierarchical Bayesian modeling is an approach in Bayesian statistics that uses hierarchical structures to model complex data. It involves specifying prior distributions for parameters at different levels of a hierarchy, allowing for the borrowing of strength across levels and the incorporation of partial pooling. This method is useful for combining information from multiple sources and improving the estimation of parameters, especially in the presence of small sample sizes or high variability.
