URL mode elicitation is a feature in MCP that allows secure out-of-band interactions for credential collection. It enables users to authenticate securely through a browser without the MCP client ever seeing the entered credentials. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios requiring secure credential collection, external OAuth flows, and payment processing.
