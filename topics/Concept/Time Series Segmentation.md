Time-Series Segmentation is the process of dividing a time series into meaningful segments or intervals based on changes in the underlying patterns or trends. This involves using segmentation algorithms to identify points in the time series where significant changes occur, allowing for the analysis of different segments independently. Common segmentation methods include sliding window techniques, dynamic programming, and change point detection algorithms. Time-series segmentation is used in various applications, such as speech recognition, activity recognition, and financial analysis, to analyze and interpret complex temporal data.
