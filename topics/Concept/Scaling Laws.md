Scaling laws refer to the empirical observations that the performance of machine learning models improves with the size of the model and the amount of training data, following specific mathematical relationships. In the context of interpretability, scaling laws are used to guide the training of sparse autoencoders and to optimize the allocation of computational resources. Scaling laws help in understanding how additional compute improves the quality of dictionary learning results and in making informed decisions about the design of sparse autoencoders. This approach is crucial for scaling interpretability to larger models and for efficiently extracting high-quality features.
