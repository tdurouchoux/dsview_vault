The Tech Assistant concept involves using language models like StarCoder to act as a technical assistant. By prompting the model with a series of dialogues, it can answer programming-related requests, provide explanations, and assist with coding tasks. This concept leverages the model's training on documentation and GitHub issues to provide helpful and accurate technical assistance.
