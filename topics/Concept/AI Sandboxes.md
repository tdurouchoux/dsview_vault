AI Sandboxes are isolated, secure environments designed for running untrusted workflows, particularly for AI agents. These sandboxes are powered by Firecracker microVMs and can execute code, install packages, and perform various tasks. They are used for tasks such as data analysis, code execution, and reinforcement learning, offering full isolation and up to 24-hour session durations.
