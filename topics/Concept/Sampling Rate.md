Sampling rate in AI model evaluations refers to the frequency with which different models are included in evaluation battles or tests. Variations in sampling rates can lead to disparities in the amount of data and feedback each model receives, potentially skewing the evaluation results. Ensuring fair and consistent sampling rates is crucial for promoting equitable evaluations and reliable rankings in AI model assessments.
