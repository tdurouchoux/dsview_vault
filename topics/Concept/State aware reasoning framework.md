The state-aware reasoning framework is a novel approach integrated into the AMIE system to enhance its diagnostic capabilities. This framework allows AMIE to adapt its responses based on its internal state, which reflects its evolving understanding of the patient's condition, diagnostic hypotheses, and uncertainties. By dynamically adjusting its actions and requests for information, the framework enables AMIE to emulate the structured, adaptive reasoning process used by experienced clinicians. It progresses through distinct phases, such as History Taking, Diagnosis & Management, and Follow-up, to ensure comprehensive and accurate diagnostic conversations.
