Intrinsic reward mechanisms in reinforcement learning involve designing rewards that encourage exploration and intrinsic motivation. These rewards are often combined with extrinsic rewards to improve learning efficiency and robustness. Techniques like Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) and Count-Based Exploration are examples of intrinsic reward mechanisms.
