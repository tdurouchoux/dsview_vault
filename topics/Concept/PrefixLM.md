PrefixLM is a pre-training strategy for vision-language models that involves using images as a prefix to a language model. The model is trained to predict the continuation of a textual sequence given the image patches and prefix text as input. This approach is particularly effective for image-conditioned text generation and visual question-answering tasks.
