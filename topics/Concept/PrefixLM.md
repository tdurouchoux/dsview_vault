PrefixLM is a pre-training strategy for vision-language models that uses images as a prefix to a language model. It involves concatenating image patch sequences and prefix text sequences as input to the encoder and predicting the continuation of the textual sequence. Models like SimVLM and VirTex use this strategy for image-conditioned text generation and visual question-answering tasks.
