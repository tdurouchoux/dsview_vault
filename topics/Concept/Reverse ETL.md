Reverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is a data integration process that involves extracting data from a data warehouse or data lake, transforming it as needed, and loading it into operational systems or applications. This process enables organizations to leverage their data warehouse or data lake as a single source of truth for all their data, making it easier to access, analyze, and act on their data across the organization.
