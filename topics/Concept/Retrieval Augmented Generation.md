Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models. It involves retrieving relevant information from a database or knowledge base and using it to augment the generation process, improving the accuracy and relevance of the generated text. RAG systems are particularly useful for handling complex, multimodal documents and providing detailed, context-aware outputs. Semantic search retrieves information based on the meaning of the query rather than just keyword matching. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines semantic search with generative models to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base before generating text.
