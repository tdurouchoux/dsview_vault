A report card in the context of machine learning and data science refers to a summary of the performance metrics and evaluations of a model. This typically includes various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and other task-specific measures. The report card provides a comprehensive overview of how well the model is performing and can be used to compare different models or versions of the same model. It is an essential tool for monitoring and improving model performance.
