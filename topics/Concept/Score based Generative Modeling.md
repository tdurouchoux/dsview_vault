Score-based Generative Modeling is a perspective on diffusion models that focuses on learning the score function of the data distribution. The score function represents the gradient of the log probability density of the data. By learning this function, the model can generate new data samples by reversing the diffusion process. This approach is connected to Variational Diffusion Models through Tweedie's Formula, providing a unified understanding of diffusion models from both variational and score-based perspectives.
