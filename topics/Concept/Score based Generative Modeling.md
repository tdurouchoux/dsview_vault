Score-based Generative Modeling is a perspective on diffusion models that focuses on learning the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary noise level. This approach is connected to the variational perspective of diffusion models through Tweedie's Formula. The score function is crucial for understanding and generating data, as it provides a gradient that points in the direction of highest probability density, enabling the generation of high-quality samples.
