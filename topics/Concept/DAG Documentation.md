DAG Documentation involves adding documentation or notes to DAGs and task objects in Airflow that are visible in the web interface. Airflow supports various attributes for rendering rich content, such as doc, doc_json, doc_yaml, doc_md, and doc_rst. These attributes allow for detailed descriptions and configurations to be displayed, enhancing the understanding and management of DAGs and tasks.
