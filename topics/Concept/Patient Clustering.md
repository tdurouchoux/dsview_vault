Patient clustering is a technique used to group patients based on similarities in their characteristics or medical data. The goal is often to identify new phenotypes or subtypes of diseases, which can aid in personalized medicine and better understanding of patient heterogeneity. However, the validity and usefulness of these clusters need rigorous statistical and clinical validation to ensure they provide meaningful and actionable insights.
