A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is a type of deep learning model designed for graph-structured data. GCNs operate directly on the graph structure by performing convolution operations on the graph's spectral domain. They are particularly useful for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. GCNs aggregate information from neighboring nodes to produce a fixed-size node embedding, which can then be used for various downstream tasks. The GCN algorithm is implemented in libraries like StellarGraph and is supported by both sparse and dense adjacency matrices.
