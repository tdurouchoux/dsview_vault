Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an early deep machine learning algorithm designed for graph-structured data. GCNs are used for tasks such as node classification, where the goal is to predict the class of a node based on its features and its connections to other nodes in the graph. GCNs operate by convolving the node features with the graph structure, allowing the network to capture both local and global graph information. StellarGraph provides implementations of GCNs and integrates smoothly with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training these models. This approach is particularly useful for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph-based recommendations.
