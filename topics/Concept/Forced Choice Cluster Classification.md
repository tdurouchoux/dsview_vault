Forced-choice cluster classification is a method of assigning each data point (e.g., patient) to a single cluster based on the results of a clustering algorithm. This approach assumes that clusters are compact and that there is no meaningful heterogeneity within a cluster. However, this assumption is often not met, and the approach can be misleading if the clusters are not well-separated or if the data points are near the boundaries between clusters.
