Machine Learning Systems Design is the process of defining the software architecture, infrastructure, algorithms, and data for a machine learning system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves creating systems that are deployable, reliable, and scalable, considering all stakeholders and their objectives. The design process includes data management, model selection, training, scaling, monitoring, and deployment, as well as addressing issues like privacy, fairness, and security.
