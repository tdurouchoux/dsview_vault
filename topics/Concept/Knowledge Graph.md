A network of interconnected facts, represented as triplets consisting of two entities (nodes) and their relationship (edge). Knowledge graphs are structured representations of information that illustrate the relationships among entities. They are used for information retrieval, semantic search, recommendation systems, and data integration, and can dynamically evolve to handle changing relationships while maintaining historical context.
