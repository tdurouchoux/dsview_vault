Autonomous agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. These agents operate independently, potentially returning to the human for further information or judgment. They are designed to handle open-ended problems where the required number of steps cannot be predicted, and they operate in a loop based on environmental feedback.
