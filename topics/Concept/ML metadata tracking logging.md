ML metadata tracking and logging involve tracking and logging metadata for each orchestrated ML workflow task. This includes metadata tracking and logging for each training job iteration (e.g., training date and time, duration, etc.), including model-specific metadata such as used parameters and the resulting performance metrics, model lineage (data and code used). This ensures the full traceability of experiment runs and helps in understanding the performance and behavior of ML models.
