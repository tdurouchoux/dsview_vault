ML metadata tracking and logging involve tracking and logging metadata for each orchestrated ML workflow task. This includes metadata such as training date and time, duration, used parameters, resulting performance metrics, and model lineage (data and code used). Metadata tracking and logging are required for each training job iteration to ensure the full traceability of experiment runs. This practice is crucial for understanding the performance and behavior of ML models, as well as for compliance and auditing purposes.
