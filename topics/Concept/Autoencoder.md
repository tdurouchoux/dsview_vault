An autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. It consists of two main components: an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation (latent space) and a decoder that reconstructs the original data from this compressed representation. In the context of Stable Diffusion, an autoencoder is used to compress images into the latent space and then reconstruct them from the processed information array. This allows for faster and more efficient image generation.
