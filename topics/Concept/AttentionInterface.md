AttentionInterface is a centralized abstraction introduced in the Transformers library to simplify the management of attention mechanisms in transformer models. It provides a standardized way to handle different attention methods, such as FA1/2/3, FlexAttention, or SDPA, making it easier to integrate and maintain new models. This abstraction helps reduce the complexity of model definitions and ensures consistency across the library.
