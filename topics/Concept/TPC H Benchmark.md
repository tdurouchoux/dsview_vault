The TPC-H Benchmark is a decision-support benchmark developed by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC). It is designed to measure and compare the performance of relational database management systems (RDBMS) in terms of query performance and data processing capabilities. The benchmark involves a suite of business-oriented ad-hoc queries and concurrent data modifications, providing a comprehensive evaluation of a system's ability to handle complex queries and large datasets. It is widely used in the industry to assess the performance of database systems and data processing frameworks.
