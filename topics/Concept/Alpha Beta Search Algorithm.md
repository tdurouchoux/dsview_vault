The Alpha-Beta search algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in artificial intelligence, particularly in game-playing scenarios. It is an optimization of the minimax algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree. The algorithm works by maintaining two values, alpha and beta, which represent the minimum score that the maximizing player is guaranteed to achieve and the maximum score that the minimizing player is guaranteed to achieve, respectively. By using these values, the algorithm can prune branches of the search tree that do not need to be explored, making the search process more efficient.
