The Alpha-Beta search algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm used in decision trees to minimize the number of nodes evaluated in minimizing and maximizing problems. It is commonly used in game-playing algorithms to decide the next move. The algorithm 'prunes' branches that do not need to be searched because there is already a better move available, optimizing the search process. In the context of Probabilistic Chess, the Alpha-Beta search algorithm is used in conjunction with the expectation-maximization algorithm to evaluate moves based on their success probabilities, making the AI more strategic and adaptive to the probabilistic nature of the game.
