WhisperVQ is a codebook used in the context of speech processing and transcription. It consists of 513 semantic tokens that represent different sound units. These tokens are used to convert speech into a format that can be processed by machine learning models. In the development of Ichigo, WhisperVQ's codebook was utilized to generate synthetic data for training the model to handle inaudible inputs and improve its transcription capabilities.
