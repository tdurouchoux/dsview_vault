WhisperVQ is a codebook used for speech tokenization. It involves converting speech into a sequence of discrete tokens that can be processed by a language model. The WhisperVQ codebook is utilized to generate synthetic data for training models to recognize and handle inaudible inputs, improving their ability to distinguish between meaningful speech and background noise.
