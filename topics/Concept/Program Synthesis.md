Program synthesis is the process of automatically generating programs or algorithms from high-level specifications or examples. It involves searching through a space of possible programs to find one that meets the given requirements. Program synthesis is a key area of research in AI, particularly in the context of the ARC benchmark, where the goal is to develop models that can synthesize new solution programs on the fly for novel tasks. This capability is seen as a crucial step towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).
