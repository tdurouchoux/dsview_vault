Program synthesis is the process of automatically generating programs from high-level specifications or examples. It involves searching through a space of possible programs to find one that meets the given requirements. In the context of the ARC benchmark, program synthesis is used to create solutions to novel puzzles by combining basic programming building blocks. This approach is seen as a potential path towards achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) by enabling machines to adapt and learn on the fly.
