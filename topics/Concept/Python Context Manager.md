A Python context manager is a construct that allows for resource management in a Python program. It is used to set up a block of code, ensuring that resources are properly acquired and released. Context managers are typically used with the 'with' statement and are implemented using classes that define the methods '__enter__' and '__exit__'. They are commonly used for file handling, database connections, and other operations that require resource management.
