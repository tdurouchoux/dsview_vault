A Python context manager is a construct that allows for the allocation and release of resources in a controlled manner. It is typically used with the 'with' statement and defines the runtime context to be established when executing a 'with' statement. Context managers are used for resource management, such as opening and closing files, establishing database connections, and acquiring and releasing locks.
