Visual Blocks for ML is a visual programming framework introduced to accelerate machine learning prototyping. It allows users to program by connecting blocks on a workspace into a flow of blocks, known as a node-graph diagram or AI pipeline. This framework provides a low-code experience, making it accessible for users to create and manage machine learning pipelines visually.
