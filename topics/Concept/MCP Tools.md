MCP Tools are functions or endpoints within an MCP server that allow LLMs to perform actions by executing code or producing side effects. These tools can be used for computations, API calls, or other operations. FastMCP handles the schema generation from type hints and docstrings, making it easier to integrate these tools into LLM workflows.
