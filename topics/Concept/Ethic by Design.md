Ethic by Design is an approach that integrates ethical considerations into the design and development process of products, systems, or services. It ensures that ethical principles are embedded throughout the lifecycle, from conception to deployment, to address potential ethical issues proactively. This approach is particularly relevant in fields like artificial intelligence, healthcare, and technology to ensure that innovations are developed responsibly and align with societal values and regulations.
