Agent Skills are organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and load dynamically to perform better at specific tasks. They extend the capabilities of general-purpose agents by packaging expertise into composable resources, transforming them into specialized agents. Skills are designed with progressive disclosure, allowing agents to load information only as needed, making them flexible and scalable. They can include code for execution and additional context files for detailed instructions, enhancing the agent's ability to handle complex tasks efficiently.
