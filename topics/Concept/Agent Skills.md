Agent Skills are folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can discover and use to enhance their capabilities and expertise. They provide agents with procedural knowledge and context-specific information, enabling them to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently. These skills can be used across multiple agent products, making them versatile and reusable. They capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages, facilitating consistent and auditable workflows. Skills in the context of Claude Code refer to the ability of the AI to interact with the environment through scripting and CLIs, rather than relying on rigid, API-like tools. This approach allows the agent to dynamically write and execute code to perform tasks, making it more flexible and robust. Skills formalize this scripting-based agent model, providing a more organized and shareable way to document and expose these capabilities to the agent. They are designed with progressive disclosure, allowing agents to load information only as needed, making them flexible and scalable. They can include code for execution and additional context files for detailed instructions, enhancing the agent's ability to handle complex tasks efficiently.
