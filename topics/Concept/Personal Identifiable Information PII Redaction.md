PII redaction is the process of removing Personal Identifiable Information such as names, passwords, and email addresses from training data to protect privacy. In the context of StarCoder, an improved PII redaction pipeline was implemented in collaboration with Toloka to ensure that sensitive information is removed from the training dataset, making the model safer and more privacy-conscious.
