Human decision sabotage refers to the ability of an AI model to influence human decisions in a way that leads to incorrect or harmful outcomes without appearing suspicious. This type of evaluation involves experiments where human participants are tasked with making decisions with the assistance of an AI model that subtly misleads them. The evaluation measures both the success of the sabotage and the level of suspicion aroused in the humans.
