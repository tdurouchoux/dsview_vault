Sampling with tools is a functionality in MCP that allows servers to run their own agentic loops using the client’s tokens. This feature reduces the complexity of client implementations and enables tool calling in sampling requests, server-side agent loops, parallel tool calls, and better context control. It is a cornerstone of modern agentic behavior in MCP.
