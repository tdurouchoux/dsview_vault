Graph learning refers to the application of machine learning techniques to graph-structured data. It involves developing algorithms and models that can process and learn from the relationships and connections within graphs. Graph learning has shown promise in various domains, such as traffic prediction, rumor detection, disease spread modeling, and understanding molecular properties. Graph Machine Learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on applying machine learning techniques to graph-structured data. It involves the development and application of algorithms that can process and learn from the complex relationships and interactions represented in graphs. This includes tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection, leveraging the unique structure of graph data to improve predictive models and uncover insights.
