Generative AI, also known as Intelligence Artificielle Générative (IAG), refers to a category of artificial intelligence algorithms that generate new content, such as images, music, or text, based on input data. It leverages models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers to create outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content. Generative AI has applications in creative industries, data augmentation, and personalized content creation, and has seen a rapid rise in popularity, making automated content production accessible to everyone.
