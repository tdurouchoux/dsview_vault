Generative AI, also known as Intelligence Artificielle Générative (IAG), refers to a category of artificial intelligence algorithms that are designed to generate new content, such as images, music, text, or other media. These models learn patterns from large datasets and use this knowledge to create new, synthetic data that is similar to the original input data. L'IAG is utilisée dans divers domaines, notamment la création de contenu, la génération de musique, la synthèse d'images et la production automatique de texte. Generative AI includes models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and large language models.
