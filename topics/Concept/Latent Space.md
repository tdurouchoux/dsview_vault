A high-dimensional space in which data points are embedded based on their features. Latent spaces are used to capture the underlying structure of data, making it easier to visualize and explore complex datasets. In the context of Latent Scope, latent spaces are used to embed unstructured data, reduce dimensionality, and cluster the resulting points for further analysis.
