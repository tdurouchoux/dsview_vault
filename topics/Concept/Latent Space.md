Latent space refers to a compressed representation of data where only the most significant features are retained. In the context of diffusion models, working in latent space involves encoding images into a lower-dimensional space before applying the diffusion process. This approach reduces computational costs and enables more efficient training and inference, making it possible to run models on consumer-grade hardware.
