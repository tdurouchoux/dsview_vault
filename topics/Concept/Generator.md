The generator is another core component in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, responsible for transforming retrieved information into natural and fluent text. The generator's design is inspired by traditional language models but is enhanced to leverage retrieved information for better accuracy and relevance. The generator's input includes both contextual information and relevant text segments obtained through the retriever. Post-retrieval processing techniques such as information compression and re-ranking are employed to optimize the retrieved content before it is passed to the generator. Fine-tuning the generator to adapt to input data from queries and documents is also crucial for improving the quality of the generated responses.
