The generator is another core component in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, responsible for transforming retrieved information into natural and fluent text. It enhances the accuracy and relevance of responses by leveraging the retrieved information. The generator's input includes not only traditional contextual information but also relevant text segments obtained through the retriever. This allows the generator to better comprehend the context behind the question and produce responses that are more information-rich. The generator is guided by the retrieved text to ensure consistency between the generated content and the retrieved information, making it a crucial part of the RAG process.
