TinyGarden is an interactive mini-game that demonstrates the capabilities of FunctionGemma. In the game, players use voice commands to manage a virtual plot of land, and the model decomposes these commands into specific app functions. TinyGarden showcases the model's ability to handle multi-turn logic to drive custom game mechanics on a mobile phone, without ever pinging a server, highlighting the potential of edge computing and function calling in gaming applications.
