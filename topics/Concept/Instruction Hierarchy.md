Instruction Hierarchy is a framework used to manage and prioritize instructions given to a language model. It involves defining a hierarchy of instructions where higher-level instructions take precedence over lower-level ones. This can include roles such as system messages, developer messages, and user messages. The hierarchy helps in controlling the model's behavior and ensuring that it adheres to specific guidelines or policies, even when conflicting instructions are provided.
