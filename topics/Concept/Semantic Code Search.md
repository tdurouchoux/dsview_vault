Semantic Code Search refers to the ability to search for code snippets based on their meaning or functionality rather than just keyword matching. This approach uses embeddings to represent code in a way that captures its semantic content, allowing for more accurate retrieval of relevant code segments from natural language or code queries. Semantic code search is particularly useful in developer tools, documentation systems, and coding assistants.
