Survey statistics involves methods for mitigating bias in samples by relying on auxiliary information, such as covariates or features. These methods are crucial for producing less biased estimates or models, especially in scenarios where data is collected from a self-selected group of participants or suffers from selection bias. Techniques include weighting the sample to the population using auxiliary information to adjust for non-response and other biases.
