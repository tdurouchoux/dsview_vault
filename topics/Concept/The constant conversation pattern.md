The constant conversation pattern is a strategy for effectively using AI-assisted coding tools by maintaining a continuous and focused dialogue with the AI. This involves starting new AI chats for each distinct task, keeping the context focused and minimal, reviewing and committing changes frequently, and maintaining tight feedback loops. By engaging in a constant conversation with the AI, developers can ensure that the AI's suggestions are relevant, accurate, and aligned with their intentions, leading to more efficient and effective development processes.
