Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a method where the rewards given to the model are verifiable and based on correct solutions. However, RLVR can fail when correct solutions are rarely sampled, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively. This method is particularly challenging for small-scale open-source models that struggle with problems requiring multi-step reasoning.
