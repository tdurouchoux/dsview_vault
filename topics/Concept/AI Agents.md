AI Agents are autonomous entities that can perform tasks or make decisions on behalf of users. These agents can interact with their environment, access information, and execute actions to achieve specific goals. AI agents can range from simple chatbots to complex systems capable of performing multi-step tasks. The development of AI agents is a growing area of research, as they have the potential to revolutionize various industries by automating tasks and providing personalized services. However, the energy requirements and environmental impact of AI agents are significant concerns, as they often require substantial computational resources. Agentic AI refers to AI systems that operate autonomously to perform tasks and make decisions with minimal human intervention. In the context of GitHub Copilot, the coding agent exemplifies agentic AI by handling low-to-medium complexity tasks, such as adding features, fixing bugs, and refactoring code. These AI agents work in the background, pushing commits to draft pull requests and requiring human approval before any changes are merged, ensuring a collaborative and secure development process. Agents are entities that can perceive their environment and act upon it. In the context of AI, agents are systems that use AI models to process tasks, plan sequences of actions, and determine task completion. They can operate in various environments and use different tools to perform actions, ranging from simple tasks like generating text to complex tasks like planning trips or managing customer accounts. Agents can be autonomous and are designed to assist, collaborate, or coach users in various domains. In the context of AI, agents refer to autonomous systems that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment based on their programming and learned behaviors. In this course, it likely refers to building AI systems that can operate semi-independently to achieve specific goals. AI Agents in the context of data science refer to autonomous entities or systems designed to perform specific tasks, often leveraging machine learning models and algorithms. These agents can operate in various environments, including digital platforms, and are capable of making decisions, executing actions, and sometimes even learning from their interactions. They are used in a wide range of applications, from automated data collection and processing to more complex tasks like personalized recommendations and interactive data analysis. In the context of AI coding assistants, an AI Agent refers to an AI teammate that can perform tasks such as planning, executing, and checking in on coding projects. This concept emphasizes the AI's ability to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows and tools, mimicking human-like interaction and task management. Agents are programs where the outputs of a language model (LLM) control the workflow. They provide LLMs with agency, allowing them to interact with the real world by calling tools or executing programs. The level of agency can vary, ranging from simple control flow to complex multi-step and multi-agent workflows. AI agents are software entities that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often interacting with users or other systems to achieve specific goals. These agents can be designed for various purposes, including customer service, personal assistance, and entertainment. In the context of large language models (LLMs), agents are systems designed to autonomously perform tasks by reasoning about their environment and taking actions through the use of tools or functions. These agents operate using a cycle of thoughts (internal reasoning), actions (executing tasks), and observations (analyzing feedback). Frameworks like LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and smolagents provide tools and methodologies for developing and deploying LLM-based agents. Multi-agent orchestration refers to the coordination and management of multiple autonomous agents working together to achieve complex tasks. This involves designing systems where agents can communicate, collaborate, and hand off tasks to each other, often using lightweight and scalable frameworks such as CrewAI. Multi-agent systems are particularly useful in scenarios requiring diverse capabilities and dynamic interactions, allowing for more flexible and adaptable solutions compared to single-agent systems. A system composed of multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate to perform complex tasks, such as generating and refining scientific hypotheses.
