AI Agents are systems that use AI models to plan and execute tasks autonomously. They can be assistants, coworkers, or coaches, helping with various tasks such as data gathering, market research, customer account management, and more. These agents are characterized by their environment and the set of actions they can perform, which are augmented by the tools they have access to. This concept emphasizes the AI's ability to operate within existing tools and workflows seamlessly. AI agents can range from simple chatbots to complex systems capable of planning, learning, and executing tasks autonomously, using language models to reason about their environment and interact with external tools or functions. They operate through a cycle of thoughts, actions, and observations, leveraging frameworks like LangGraph, LlamaIndex, and smolagents to streamline development. Autonomous agents are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks. These agents are used for open-ended problems where it is difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps and where you cannot hardcode a fixed path. They are ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments but require extensive testing and appropriate guardrails.
