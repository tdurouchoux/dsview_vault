An AI co-scientist is a multi-agent AI system designed to function as a collaborative tool for scientists. Built on advanced AI models like Gemini 2.0, it aims to generate novel research hypotheses, detailed research overviews, and experimental protocols. The system uses specialized agents inspired by the scientific method to iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine hypotheses, enhancing scientific discovery and collaboration.
