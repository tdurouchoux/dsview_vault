The Claude Code GitHub Action (GHA) is a feature that integrates Claude Code with GitHub Actions, allowing developers to run Claude Code in a GitHub Actions workflow. This integration provides a customizable and auditable way to operationalize Claude Code, turning it into a core part of the engineering system. The GHA supports advanced features like hooks and MCP, and it can be used to build custom tooling, such as PR-from-anywhere functionality, which allows users to trigger pull requests from various sources like Slack, Jira, or CloudWatch alerts.
