Parlant is a framework designed for building LLM agents with controlled and predictable behavior. It allows developers to define rules and guidelines in natural language, ensuring that the agents follow these rules consistently. Parlant provides features like conversational journeys, dynamic guideline matching, reliable tool integration, conversation analytics, iterative refinement, built-in guardrails, a React widget for easy integration, and full explainability. It is particularly useful for creating customer-facing agents that need to comply with specific business requirements and handle edge cases consistently.
