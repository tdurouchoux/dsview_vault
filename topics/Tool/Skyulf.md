Skyulf is a self-hosted MLOps platform designed for teams that need to maintain data privacy and comply with regulations like GDPR. It allows users to build, train, and monitor machine learning pipelines entirely on their own infrastructure, ensuring that data never leaves their servers. Skyulf is particularly useful for healthcare, government, and research sectors where data sensitivity is paramount. It offers features such as visual feature engineering, background training, one-click deployment, and continuous monitoring for data and concept drift. The tool is open-source and free for local use, with a vision to democratize AI development through an upcoming 'App Hub' for creating AI tools without extensive expertise or cloud budgets.
