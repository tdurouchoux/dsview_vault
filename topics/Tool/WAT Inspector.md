WAT Inspector is a powerful inspection tool designed to help users explore and examine unknown Python objects at runtime. It provides detailed information about the type, formatted value, variables, methods, parent types, signature, documentation, and source code of any object. This tool is particularly useful for debugging or understanding intricate data structures in Python, offering a straightforward way to answer 'what' exactly an object represents. It supports various modifiers to customize the output, such as hiding attributes, displaying dunder attributes, showing source code, and more. WAT Inspector can be used in Python interpreters, scripts, and debugging sessions to enhance the understanding and manipulation of Python objects.
