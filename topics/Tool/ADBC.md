ADBC (Asynchronous Database Connectivity) is a modern database connectivity API designed for high-performance data access. It provides an asynchronous interface for interacting with databases, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation. ADBC is particularly useful in environments where low-latency and high-throughput data access are critical.
