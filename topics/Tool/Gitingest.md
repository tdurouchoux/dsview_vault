Gitingest is a tool designed to turn any Git repository into a prompt-friendly text ingest for large language models (LLMs). It allows users to replace 'hub' with 'ingest' in any GitHub URL to access a digest of the codebase. Gitingest provides features such as easy code context, smart formatting optimized for LLM prompts, and statistics about file and directory structure, size of the extract, and token count. It is available as a CLI tool, Python package, and can be self-hosted using Docker. Gitingest supports both public and private repositories, with the latter requiring a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
