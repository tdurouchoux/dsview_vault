A tool for measuring cognitive complexity in Python code, designed to evaluate how difficult code is for humans to understand. It provides insights into code complexity, helping developers identify and refactor complex code to maintain cleaner and more maintainable codebases. Complexipy is written in Rust for performance and integrates with various development workflows, including command-line usage, Python API, GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and VS Code extensions. It supports configuration through TOML files and offers features like snapshot baselines and inline ignores to manage code complexity effectively.
