OpenHands is a scaffold or framework designed to facilitate the use of models like Devstral for software engineering tasks. It provides an interface and environment for interacting with the model, allowing users to deploy and utilize the model's capabilities for tasks such as code generation, editing, and exploration. OpenHands can be run locally using Docker and provides a user interface for interacting with the model, making it accessible for users to build and iterate on software projects.
