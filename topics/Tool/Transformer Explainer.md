Transformer Explainer is an interactive visualization tool designed to help users learn how Transformer-based models like GPT work. It runs a live GPT-2 model in the browser, allowing users to experiment with text and observe in real-time how internal components and operations of the Transformer collaborate to predict the next tokens.
