The AI Dataset Generator is a tool designed to create realistic datasets for demos, learning, and dashboards. It allows users to define parameters such as business type and schema, and then generates data that can be previewed, exported as CSV or SQL, and explored using Metabase. The tool leverages large language models to generate detailed data specifications and uses Faker.js to create realistic data rows locally. It supports multiple LLM providers through LiteLLM and can be run locally or accessed via a web interface.
