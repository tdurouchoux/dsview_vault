Visual Copilot is a tool developed by Builder.io that converts design specifications into code. It uses a combination of fine-tuned LLMs, custom compilers, and custom-trained models to achieve high-quality results. This tool is designed to be faster, more reliable, and cheaper than solutions relying solely on large language models.
