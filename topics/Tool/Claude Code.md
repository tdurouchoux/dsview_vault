Claude Code is a command line tool for agentic coding, enabling developers to delegate substantial engineering tasks directly from their terminal. It can search and read code, edit files, write and run tests, commit and push code to GitHub, and use command line tools. Claude Code is designed to reduce development time and overhead, making it particularly useful for test-driven development, debugging complex issues, and large-scale refactoring. It is available as a limited research preview.
