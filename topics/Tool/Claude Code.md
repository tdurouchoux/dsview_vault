Claude Code is an agentic coding tool introduced by Anthropic. It is designed to assist developers by performing tasks such as searching and reading code, editing files, writing and running tests, committing and pushing code to GitHub, and using command line tools. Claude Code is available as a limited research preview and aims to reduce development time and overhead by automating complex tasks. It is particularly useful for test-driven development, debugging, and large-scale refactoring.
