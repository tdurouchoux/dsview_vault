The Claude SDK is a software development kit that allows developers to build custom agents and tools using the Claude ecosystem. It supports various features such as massive parallel scripting, building internal chat tools, and rapid agent prototyping. The SDK is designed to be a powerful, general-purpose agent framework that can be used for both coding and non-coding tasks, making it a versatile tool for enhancing productivity and automation. It includes solutions for memory management across long-running tasks, permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and coordination of subagents working toward a shared goal.
