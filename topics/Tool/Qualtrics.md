Qualtrics is an experience management and advanced research platform that supports creating surveys and collecting data. It provides tools for data entry with form views, data validation, and the ability to use both numeric values and their contextual labels. It is particularly useful for one-time data entry but is less suitable for ongoing data editing and management.
