Kotaemon is an open-source RAG-based tool designed for chatting with documents. It offers a clean and customizable UI for both end users and developers. End users can perform QA on their documents, while developers can build their own RAG pipelines. Kotaemon supports various LLMs, including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Cohere, and local LLMs via Ollama and llama-cpp-python. It features a hybrid RAG pipeline with full-text and vector retrievers, advanced citations, multi-modal QA support, and configurable settings. Kotaemon is built with Gradio and can be customized or extended by developers.
