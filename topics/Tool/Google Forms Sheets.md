Google Forms and Google Sheets are tools provided by Google for creating surveys and spreadsheets, respectively. Google Forms allows for data entry with some data validation, while Google Sheets offers more extensive data validation options. These tools are useful for one-time data entry but are less ideal for ongoing data editing. They provide similar functionality to Microsoft Excel but may not meet certain security requirements for confidential data.
