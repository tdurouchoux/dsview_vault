Google Forms and Sheets are tools for data entry and management. Data entry can be done in form view using Google Forms or in spreadsheet view using Google Sheets. Google Forms offers limited data validation, while Google Sheets provides more extensive data validation options. These tools are best suited for one-time data entry tasks and offer functionality similar to Microsoft Excel. However, they may not meet the security requirements for confidential data.
