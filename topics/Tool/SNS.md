Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. It enables you to send notifications to subscribers or other applications by using a 'publish-subscribe' model, making it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
