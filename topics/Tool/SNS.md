Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. It enables the sending of notifications to various endpoints such as email, SMS, and mobile push notifications, making it easy to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.
