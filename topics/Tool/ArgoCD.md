ArgoCD is a declarative continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It follows the GitOps approach, where the desired state of the infrastructure is stored in a Git repository, and ArgoCD continuously monitors and applies the desired state to the actual state of the Kubernetes cluster. ArgoCD automates the deployment of applications to Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that the cluster state matches the desired state defined in the Git repository. It supports automated synchronization, rollback, and health monitoring of deployed applications.
