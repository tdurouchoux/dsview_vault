Jupyter AI is an open-source tool that integrates generative artificial intelligence into Jupyter notebooks. It allows users to explain and generate code, fix errors, summarize content, ask questions about local files, and create entire notebooks from natural language prompts. It supports various large language models (LLMs) from providers like AI21, Anthropic, AWS, Cohere, and OpenAI, and uses LangChain to support popular LLMs and providers. It is designed with responsible AI and data privacy in mind, allowing users to track AI-generated code and control data usage.
