A scientific instrument for investigating latent spaces. It encodes a process that is increasingly common in AI and data science workflows: Embed unstructured data into high-dimensional vectors, reduce the dimensionality of those vectors, cluster the resulting points, label the clusters with an LLM and then explore the annotated data. It provides a web interface for each step and an interactive visualization tightly coupled with the input data.
