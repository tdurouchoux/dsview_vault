Latent Scope is a scientific instrument designed for investigating latent spaces. It allows users to embed unstructured data into high-dimensional vectors, reduce dimensionality, cluster the resulting points, label the clusters with an LLM, and explore the annotated data through an interactive visualization. It supports various open-source embedding models and proprietary API services, providing a comprehensive tool for visualizing and exploring datasets through latent spaces.
