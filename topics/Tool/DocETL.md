DocETL is an open-source system designed for building LLM-powered data processing pipelines. It offers declarative operators that can be optimized for accuracy in large-scale, complex document analysis tasks. DocETL allows users to define pipelines using YAML or Python, and it automatically optimizes these pipelines for better performance. The system is particularly useful for processing unstructured text data, providing a higher level of abstraction to handle complex document processing tasks efficiently.
