DocETL is an open-source system designed for building LLM-powered data processing pipelines. It offers declarative operators that can be optimized for accuracy, making it easier to handle complex document analysis tasks. DocETL allows users to define pipelines in YAML or Python, which are then optimized automatically. It includes features like document splitting, context-aware processing, and iterative refinement to improve the accuracy and efficiency of processing unstructured data.
