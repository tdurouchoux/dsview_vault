uv is a tool for managing Python projects, which define their dependencies in a pyproject.toml file. It supports creating new projects, managing dependencies, running commands, and building distributions. uv also creates and manages a virtual environment for the project, ensuring that dependencies are isolated and reproducible across different machines.
