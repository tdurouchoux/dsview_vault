Apache Parquet is a popular, free, open-source, column-oriented data storage format. It is designed to be efficiently queried directly, allowing users to read individual columns instead of always having to read all of them. Parquet files are typically much smaller than CSV or JSON due to lightweight columnar compression and general-purpose compression. It is widely used as a data interchange format and is supported by many query engines and data lake solutions like Delta Lake and Iceberg. Parquet is an open-source columnar storage file format optimized for use with big data processing frameworks. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, which significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be read from disk, making it highly efficient for analytical queries. Parquet is widely used in data lakes and lakehouse architectures due to its performance and compatibility with various data processing tools. It is designed to work efficiently with columnar data and supports nested data types, making it ideal for storing text embeddings along with their metadata. Parquet files are compressed and can be read and written quickly, making them suitable for portable and efficient data storage.
