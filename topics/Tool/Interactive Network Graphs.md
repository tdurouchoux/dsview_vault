Interactive Network Graphs are visual representations of data that allow users to dynamically explore and interact with the graph elements. These tools are particularly useful for visualizing complex relationships and connections within data, enabling users to zoom, click, and hover over nodes and edges to gain insights. They are widely used in fields such as social network analysis, biology, and information technology to make sense of intricate data structures.
