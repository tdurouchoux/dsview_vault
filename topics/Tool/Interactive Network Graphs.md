Interactive Network Graphs are visual representations of data that allow users to explore and interact with the graph elements dynamically. These tools are essential for visualizing complex relationships and connections within data, enabling users to zoom, click, and manipulate the graph to gain insights. They are widely used in fields like social network analysis, biology, and information technology to understand patterns and structures in data.
