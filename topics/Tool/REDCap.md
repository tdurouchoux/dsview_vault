REDCap is a data entry tool that allows for form-based data entry, reducing errors, and supports data validation. It enables querying across forms within the same project but lacks the ability to query across different projects without administrative access. It is particularly useful for researchers working with survey data, as it allows for the use of value labels for numeric variables and the option to export data as either numeric values or labels.
