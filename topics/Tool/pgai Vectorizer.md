Pgai Vectorizer is an open-source tool that implements the vectorizer abstraction in PostgreSQL. It automates the creation and updating of vector embeddings from source data tables, ensuring that embeddings remain synchronized with the underlying data. This tool is part of the PGAI project, which aims to enhance PostgreSQL for AI systems and make AI development more accessible.
