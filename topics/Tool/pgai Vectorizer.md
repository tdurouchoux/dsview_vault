An open-source tool designed to simplify the management of vector embeddings in PostgreSQL. It automates the creation and updating of embeddings, ensuring they stay in sync with the source data. This tool integrates with pgvector and pgvectorscale extensions, making it easier to handle vector search operations within PostgreSQL. By treating embeddings as derived data, pgai Vectorizer reduces the complexity and maintenance burden associated with traditional vector databases.
