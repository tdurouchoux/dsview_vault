Monolith is a deep learning framework specifically designed for large-scale recommendation modeling. It introduces two key features: collisionless embedding tables and real-time training. Collisionless embedding tables ensure unique representations for different ID features, while real-time training helps capture the latest trends and user interests rapidly. Monolith is built on top of TensorFlow and supports both batch and real-time training and serving.
