DocWrangler is an interactive development environment (IDE) designed for building and refining LLM-powered data processing pipelines. It provides an interactive layer for exploring data, experimenting with different operations, and refining pipelines based on discoveries. It is built on top of DocETL and aims to fill the gap in existing development interfaces by offering rich, immediate feedback loops and tools for exploring and validating LLM outputs at scale.
