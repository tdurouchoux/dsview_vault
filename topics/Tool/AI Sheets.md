AI Sheets is an open-source tool designed for building, enriching, and transforming datasets using AI models without requiring any coding. It offers a user-friendly interface similar to a spreadsheet, facilitating quick experimentation and iteration. Users can create new columns by writing prompts, iterate on results, and validate cells to guide the model's output. AI Sheets supports integration with thousands of open models from the Hugging Face Hub via Inference Providers or local models, including gpt-oss from OpenAI. It can be deployed locally or on the Hub, making it versatile for various data manipulation tasks.
