RagBuilder is a toolkit designed to create optimal, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setups. It automates the process of hyperparameter tuning for various RAG parameters, evaluates configurations against test datasets, and includes pre-defined, high-performance RAG templates. It supports features like hyperparameter tuning, pre-defined RAG templates, evaluation dataset options, component access, API deployment, and project persistence. It is designed to optimize and deploy RAG pipelines efficiently, making it easier to integrate RAG into production environments.
