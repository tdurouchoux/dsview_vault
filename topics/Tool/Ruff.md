Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It aims to be orders of magnitude faster than alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface. Ruff can replace multiple tools like Flake8, Black, isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and autoflake, executing tens or hundreds of times faster. It is actively developed and used in major open-source projects such as Apache Airflow, Apache Superset, FastAPI, Hugging Face, Pandas, and SciPy. Ruff is backed by Astral and is known for its speed, with testimonials highlighting its performance improvements over traditional linters and formatters.
