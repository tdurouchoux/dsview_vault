Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It is particularly well-suited for complex computational workflows and is used to ease the process of scheduling and running data engineering and data science tasks. Airflow uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to manage workflows, making it easier to define and schedule tasks and dependencies.
