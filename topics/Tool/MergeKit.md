MergeKit is an open-source library designed for merging large language models. It provides an efficient and extensible framework for combining model checkpoints to improve performance and versatility without additional training. MergeKit supports various merging algorithms and can operate on both CPU and GPU, making it accessible for resource-constrained situations. It is used for creating versatile models by combining specialized models, transferring capabilities, and finding optimal trade-offs between different model behaviors.
