Docling is a library and set of models developed by IBM Research for parsing and converting document formats, particularly PDFs. It employs a pipeline approach that combines modules for file parsing, layout analysis, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table structure recognition, and post-processing to generate a unified, structured format. Docling is designed to work seamlessly with spaCy, enhancing its capabilities for document processing and information extraction.
