Docling is a tool developed by IBM Research for parsing and converting document formats, including PDFs. It uses a pipeline approach that combines modules for file parsing, layout analysis, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table structure recognition, and postprocessing to generate a unified, structured format. This makes it a great complement to spaCy, which is designed around the structured Doc object, a container for linguistic annotations that always map back into the original document.
