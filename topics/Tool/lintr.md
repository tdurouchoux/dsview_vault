lintr is an R package used for static code analysis and linting. It checks R code for potential errors, style issues, and adherence to coding standards, providing feedback to help improve code quality. lintr integrates with the R development environment to highlight issues in real-time, making it easier for developers to write clean, maintainable, and error-free code. It is often used in conjunction with other tools like {styler} to enforce consistent coding practices within a team.
