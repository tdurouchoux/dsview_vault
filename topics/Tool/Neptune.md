Neptune is an experiment tracking tool designed for teams that run a lot of experiments. It allows users to log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all model-building metadata. Neptune provides a single place to monitor and visualize metrics such as losses, gradients, and activations, making it easier to debug training issues and compare experiments. It supports integration with various machine learning frameworks and is suitable for tracking experiments at any scale.
