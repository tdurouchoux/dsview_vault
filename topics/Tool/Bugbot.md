Bugbot is a code review agent designed to analyze pull requests for logic bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities before they reach production. It employs multiple bug-finding passes in parallel, combines results with majority voting, and uses a validator model to catch false positives. Bugbot has evolved significantly since its initial release, incorporating advanced features like an agentic architecture and continuous improvement through experiments and metrics like resolution rate.
