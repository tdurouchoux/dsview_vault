Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is widely used for source code management, allowing multiple people to work on the same project without encountering conflicts. Git tracks changes in files, enabling users to revert to previous states, branch code for parallel development, and merge changes seamlessly. It is essential for collaborative software development and is known for its robust branching and merging capabilities.
