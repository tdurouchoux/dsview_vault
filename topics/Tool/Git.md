Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, enabling multiple people to work on a codebase simultaneously without overwhelmingly stepping on each other toes. It is widely used for software development and other version-controlled projects to manage changes, collaborate, and maintain a history of modifications.
