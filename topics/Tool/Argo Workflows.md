Argo Workflows is an open-source container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. It is designed to run workflows as Kubernetes pods, making it highly scalable and suitable for running complex, multi-step workflows. Argo Workflows supports defining workflows as YAML files, which can include parallel tasks, conditional logic, and retries. It is often used for machine learning pipelines, data processing, and other batch jobs that require orchestration.
