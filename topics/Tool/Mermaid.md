Mermaid is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that uses text definitions to render diagrams dynamically. It supports a wide variety of diagrams, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, Gantt charts, pie charts, journey diagrams, and more. It is particularly useful for creating diagrams directly within markdown files, making it a popular tool for documentation and technical writing.
