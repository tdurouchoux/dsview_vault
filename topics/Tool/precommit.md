precommit is an R package that helps enforce code quality and style consistency by running checks before code is committed to a repository. It integrates with Git to automatically run specified checks, such as linting and formatting, ensuring that code adheres to predefined standards before it is saved. precommit helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase by catching potential issues early in the development process, making it easier for teams to collaborate and maintain high-quality code.
