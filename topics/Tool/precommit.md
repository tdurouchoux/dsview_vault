precommit is an R package that helps automate the process of running code checks before committing changes to a repository. It allows developers to set up hooks that run specific checks or tasks, such as linting or testing, whenever a commit is made. By using precommit, teams can ensure that code meets certain quality standards before it is added to the repository, reducing the likelihood of introducing errors or stylistic issues.
