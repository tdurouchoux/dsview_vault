The Claude Agent SDK is a set of tools and infrastructure that powers Claude Code. It includes solutions for memory management across long-running tasks, permission systems that balance autonomy with user control, and coordination of subagents working toward a shared goal. This SDK is designed to help developers build their own AI agents with similar capabilities to those in Claude Code.
