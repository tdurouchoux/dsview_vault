Prefect is a workflow orchestration system used to manage and automate complex data pipelines. It helps in scheduling, running, and monitoring data workflows, ensuring that different stages of a data process are executed in the correct order and handled appropriately. In the VERDAD project, Prefect is used to orchestrate the various stages of the misinformation detection pipeline, from audio recording to the generation of snippets and their analysis.
