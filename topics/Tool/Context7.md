Context7 is a tool designed to provide up-to-date code documentation for large language models (LLMs) and AI code editors. It integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to fetch version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source, ensuring that the information provided is current and accurate. Context7 helps avoid issues like outdated code examples and hallucinated APIs by pulling the latest documentation into the LLM's context.
