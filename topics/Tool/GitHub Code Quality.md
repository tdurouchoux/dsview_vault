GitHub Code Quality is a tool that provides organization-wide visibility, governance, and reporting to improve code maintainability, reliability, and test coverage. It extends Copilot’s security checks to assess the maintainability and reliability impact of code changes, helping to prevent long-term technical debt and ensuring code health across repositories.
