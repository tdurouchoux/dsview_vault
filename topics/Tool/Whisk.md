Whisk is a new experimental tool from Google Labs that allows users to input or create images to convey the subject, scene, and style they have in mind. It combines the latest Imagen 3 model with Geminiâ€™s visual understanding and description capabilities. Whisk automatically writes detailed captions of user images and feeds those descriptions into Imagen 3, allowing users to remix their subjects, scenes, and styles in new ways. Whisk is designed to be a fun and creative tool for visualizing ideas.
