Whisk is an experimental tool from Google Labs that allows users to input or create images to convey subjects, scenes, and styles. Users can remix these images to create unique visual content, such as digital plushies or enamel pins. Whisk combines the latest Imagen 3 model with Geminiâ€™s visual understanding and description capabilities. The Gemini model automatically writes detailed captions of the user's images, which are then fed into Imagen 3 to generate new visual content. Whisk is designed to make the process of creating and remixing images fun and accessible.
