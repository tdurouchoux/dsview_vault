AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. It automatically manages the underlying compute resources, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server management. Lambda runs your code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, changes to data in an S3 bucket, or messages from an SQS queue.
