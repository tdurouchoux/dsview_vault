AWS Lambda is a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. It automatically manages the underlying compute resources, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server management. Lambda functions are triggered by events and can be used for various tasks such as data processing, backend services, and automating workflows.
