pgRouting is an open-source extension for the Postgres database that enables geospatial routing functionality. It provides tools and functions for analyzing and solving routing problems, such as finding the shortest path, within a geographical network represented as a graph. pgRouting leverages the spatial capabilities of Postgres and PostGIS to perform complex network analyses, making it a valuable tool for applications in logistics, transportation, and urban planning.
