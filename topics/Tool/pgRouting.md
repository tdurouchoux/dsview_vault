pgRouting is an open-source extension for the Postgres database that enables graph-based routing functionality. It is designed to provide geospatial routing capabilities, allowing users to perform analyses such as shortest path calculations, travel time matrices, and other network-based computations. pgRouting leverages the spatial data stored in Postgres and integrates with PostGIS, a spatial database extender for Postgres, to offer advanced routing and network analysis features. It is widely used in applications like logistics, transportation planning, and geographic information systems (GIS).
