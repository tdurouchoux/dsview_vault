FastText is a library developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) team for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification. It is known for its speed and efficiency, particularly in handling large datasets. FastText represents each word as an n-gram of characters, which allows it to capture morphological information and perform well even with rare words or out-of-vocabulary words. It is commonly used for text classification tasks.
