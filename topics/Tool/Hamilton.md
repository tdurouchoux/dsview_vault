Hamilton is an open-source platform designed to facilitate the creation and management of dataflows in Python. It allows users to define data transformation steps as individual Python functions, making it easier to build, test, and maintain data pipelines. Hamilton aims to reduce the trade-off between writing high-quality, maintainable code and rapidly developing and deploying data projects. It offers features like easy unit and integration testing, debugging capabilities, and visualization of data lineage, which help in creating robust and understandable data systems.
