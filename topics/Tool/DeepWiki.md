DeepWiki is a tool that automatically indexes repositories and generates wikis with architecture diagrams, links to sources, and summaries of codebases. It helps users understand unfamiliar parts of their codebase by providing detailed documentation and context. DeepWiki can be steered using a configuration file to prioritize specific folders and components, ensuring comprehensive coverage even in large repositories.
