DeepWiki is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically generate comprehensive documentation for code repositories. It creates architecture diagrams, documentation, and links to source code, helping users understand unfamiliar codebases quickly. DeepWiki can be steered using a configuration file to ensure important components are documented, making it particularly useful for large repositories.
