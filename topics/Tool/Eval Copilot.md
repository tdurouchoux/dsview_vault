Eval Copilot is a tool launched by Atla to help users leverage Seleneâ€™s instruction-following capabilities. It allows users to automatically generate, test, and refine custom evaluation metrics with just a description of their task, requiring little-to-no prompt engineering. The tool is designed to help users build evaluation metrics for custom use cases and is available in open beta.
