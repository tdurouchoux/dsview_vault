Eval Copilot is a tool designed to help users generate, test, and refine custom evaluation metrics. It allows users to describe their task and automatically creates evaluation prompts. The tool also supports adjusting prompts by describing desired changes and adding few-shot examples. Eval Copilot is integrated with the Selene models to leverage their customizability and instruction-following capabilities.
