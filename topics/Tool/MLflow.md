MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It includes features for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and managing and deploying models. MLflow is framework-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any machine learning library, and it supports various stages of the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.
