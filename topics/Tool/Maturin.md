Maturin is a tool that simplifies the process of building and packaging Rust projects for use in Python. It compiles Rust code and prepares it as a Python wheel package, which can then be installed and used like any other Python library. Maturin streamlines the integration of Rust and Python, making it easier to develop performant and secure applications.
