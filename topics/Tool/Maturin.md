Maturin is a tool that simplifies the process of compiling Rust code and preparing it as a Python wheel package. It streamlines the build process, making it easier to integrate Rust modules into Python projects. Maturin is particularly useful for developers looking to combine the performance of Rust with the flexibility of Python.
