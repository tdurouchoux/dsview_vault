spaCyLayout is an extension for spaCy that adds document processing capabilities for PDFs, Word documents, and other formats. It outputs clean, text-based data in a structured format. Document and section layout features are accessible via a layout extension attribute and can be serialized in an efficient binary format. This tool allows users to process documents and create spaCy Doc objects, which can then be passed to pretrained NLP pipelines for further analysis.
