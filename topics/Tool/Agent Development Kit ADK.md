An open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control. It is designed to make agent development feel more like software development, allowing developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate agentic architectures ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows. ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and built for compatibility with other frameworks, optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem.
