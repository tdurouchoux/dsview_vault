GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It allows users to host repositories, manage code changes through pull requests, and facilitate code reviews. GitHub supports collaboration by enabling multiple contributors to work on the same project, track changes, and discuss improvements. It is widely used in both software development and data science for managing and reviewing code.
