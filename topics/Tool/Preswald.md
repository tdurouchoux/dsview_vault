Preswald is a static-site generator for building interactive data apps in Python. It packages compute, data access, and UI into self-contained data apps that run locally in the browser. Built on a WASM runtime with Pyodide and DuckDB, Preswald enables portable, file-based apps that are fast, reactive, and shareable. It is designed to bundle logic, UI, and data into a shareable file, making it useful for creating dashboards, reports, prototypes, workflows, and notebooks that are reactive, portable, and secure by default.
