Spec Kit is an open-source toolkit designed to facilitate spec-driven development. It provides a structured process to integrate coding agents like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, and Gemini CLI into the development workflow. The toolkit helps in generating, testing, and validating code based on detailed specifications, ensuring higher-quality and more reliable code outputs. It emphasizes creating living, executable artifacts that evolve with the project, making the specification the central source of truth.
