Local Deep Research (LDR) is an AI-powered research assistant designed for deep, iterative research. It breaks down complex questions into focused sub-queries, searches multiple sources in parallel (including web, academic papers, and local documents), and verifies information across sources for accuracy. LDR creates comprehensive reports with proper citations, aiming to help researchers, students, and professionals find accurate information quickly while maintaining transparency about sources. It supports both local and cloud-based large language models (LLMs) and integrates with various search engines and vector stores.
