A data model for financial crime investigations and document forensics. It contains definitions of entities relevant in such research (like people or companies) and tools that let you generate, validate, and export such data easily. Entities can reference each other, creating a graph of relevant relationships. The ontology defined by FtM also includes a model for various types of documents that might be used as evidence in investigations.
