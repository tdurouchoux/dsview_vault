PostgreSQL, often simply called Postgres, is a powerful, open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its extensibility and standards compliance. It uses and manipulates Postgres schemas, primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and data types. It supports a large part of the SQL standard and offers many modern features like transactional integrity, concurrent editing, and crash recovery, nested transactions, materialized views, table inheritance, and asynchronous replication. It combines the robustness of database management systems with the simplicity and familiarity of spreadsheet interfaces.
