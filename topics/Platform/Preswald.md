Preswald is a WASM packager for Python-based interactive data apps. It bundles complex data workflows, particularly visualizations, into single files that run completely in-browser. It uses Pyodide, DuckDB, Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib to build dashboards, reports, and notebooks that run offline, load fast, and are shareable like a document.
