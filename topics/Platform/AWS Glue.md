AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to make it easy for customers to prepare and load data for analytics. AWS Glue provides a serverless environment that automatically discovers and profiles data, suggests schemas, and generates code to transform data. It integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon RDS, to provide a seamless data integration experience.
