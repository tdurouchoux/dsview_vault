Corese is a software platform designed for the Semantic Web of Linked Data. It allows users to create, manipulate, parse, serialize, query, reason, and validate RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. Corese implements various W3C standards such as RDF, RDFS, SPARQL 1.1 Query & Update, OWL RL, and SHACL. Additionally, it supports extensions like STTL SPARQL, SPARQL Rule, and LDScript. The platform offers multiple interfaces, including a Java library, a command-line interface, a graphical user interface, a server tool for managing SPARQL endpoints, and a Python wrapper for accessing and manipulating RDF data.
