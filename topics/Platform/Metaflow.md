Metaflow is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development, management, and deployment of real-life machine learning, AI, and data science projects. It allows users to build robust workflows in plain Python, manage library dependencies, version data and variables automatically, and scale computations in the cloud. Metaflow supports integration with various cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, and can be deployed on Kubernetes for maximum flexibility. It is particularly useful for data scientists and ML engineers who need to transition from local development to production seamlessly.
