AWS Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and users pay only for the queries they run. AWS Athena is designed to process structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and it supports a wide range of data formats, including CSV, JSON, ORC, Parquet, and Avro. It integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon QuickSight and Amazon EMR, to provide a complete analytics solution.
