AWS Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. It is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries you run. Athena is often used for ad-hoc querying and analytics on large datasets stored in S3.
