Apache Beam is an open-source, unified model for batch and streaming data processing. It allows users to write data processing pipelines that can run on multiple execution environments, providing flexibility and avoiding vendor lock-in. Apache Beam supports multiple languages, including Java, Python, and Go, and is used for mission-critical production workloads. It is designed to be extensible, with projects like TensorFlow Extended and Apache Hop built on top of it. Apache Beam enables users to create multi-language pipelines and offers features such as data sourcing, processing, and writing to various data sinks.
