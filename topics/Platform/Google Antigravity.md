Google Antigravity is a new agentic development platform introduced by Google. It leverages the advanced reasoning, tool use, and agentic coding capabilities of Gemini 3 to transform AI assistance into an active partner for developers. This platform enables developers to operate at a higher, task-oriented level, with agents that can autonomously plan and execute complex, end-to-end software tasks.
