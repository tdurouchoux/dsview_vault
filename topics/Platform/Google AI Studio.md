Google AI Studio is a platform provided by Google that allows developers to easily build and test AI-powered applications. It offers a "build mode" where users can quickly test model capabilities, remix existing apps, or create new ones with simple prompts. The platform supports the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, enabling users to deploy apps directly from Google AI Studio or save the code to GitHub. It provides template apps that demonstrate various capabilities of the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image model, such as character consistency, prompt-based image editing, and multi-image fusion.
