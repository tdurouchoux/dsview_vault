DeepWalk is a pioneering method for combining graph data with neural networks. Developed by Bryan Perozzi and colleagues, DeepWalk uses a neural network encoder to convert graph data into numeric representations (graph embeddings). This approach captures the similarities between graph objects, making it easier for neural networks to understand and process graph-structured data.
