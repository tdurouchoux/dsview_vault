Meta Models refer to a family of language models developed by Meta (formerly Facebook). These models are designed to excel in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, and summarization. Llama 3 is a large language model developed by research scientists and engineers from Meta. It is trained on trillions of tokens and supports a context length of 128K. Llama 3 is available in two model sizes: 8B and 70B parameters. It is designed to provide advanced capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in AI and machine learning.
