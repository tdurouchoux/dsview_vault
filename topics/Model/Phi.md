A family of Transformer-based language models designed for code generation and complex reasoning. They are trained on a combination of high-quality textbook data and synthetic exercises, achieving notable performance on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. The Phi family includes models of varying sizes, such as the 1.3B-parameter Phi-1 and the 14B-parameter Phi-4, which excels in complex reasoning, particularly in math.
