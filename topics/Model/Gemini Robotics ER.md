Gemini Robotics-ER is a vision-language model that enhances Gemini 2.0's capabilities with advanced spatial reasoning, specifically designed for robotics. It allows roboticists to connect it with existing low-level controllers and perform tasks such as perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning, and code generation. This model significantly improves the success rate of controlling robots in real-world scenarios.
