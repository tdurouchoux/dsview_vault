Mini-Gemini is a framework designed to enhance multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). It aims to bridge the performance gap between basic VLMs and advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini by improving visual tokens, utilizing high-quality data, and enabling VLM-guided generation. The framework supports various Large Language Models (LLMs) from 2B to 34B and demonstrates leading performance in zero-shot benchmarks.
