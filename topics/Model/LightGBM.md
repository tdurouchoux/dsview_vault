LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a highly efficient and scalable implementation of the gradient boosting framework. It uses tree-based learning algorithms and is designed to be distributed and efficient, especially for large-scale data. LightGBM employs techniques like histogram-based algorithms and leaf-wise growth with depth limitation, which make it faster and more memory-efficient compared to other boosting frameworks. It is widely used in machine learning competitions and industrial applications due to its performance and speed.
