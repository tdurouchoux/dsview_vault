ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a class of time series prediction models. It uses past values and past errors to predict future values. The model is defined by three parameters: p (number of past values to consider), d (number of differences needed to achieve stationarity), and q (number of past forecast errors to consider). ARIMA is effective for time series data and requires the time series to be standardized to be independent from seasonal or temporary trends.
