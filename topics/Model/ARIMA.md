ARIMA, which stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, is a popular statistical model used for time series forecasting. It combines three main components: autoregression (AR), integration (I), and moving average (MA). The AR component models the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations, the I component makes the time series stationary by differencing, and the MA component models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
