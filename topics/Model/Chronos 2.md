Chronos-2 is a foundation model designed to handle arbitrary forecasting tasks—univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed—in a zero-shot manner. It leverages in-context learning (ICL) to enable these capabilities without additional training. Chronos-2 can jointly predict multiple coevolving time series, capturing dependencies that improve overall accuracy. It also incorporates external factors that influence predictions, supporting past-only covariates, known future covariates, and categorical covariates. The model's enhanced ICL capabilities improve univariate forecasting by enabling cross-learning, leading to more accurate predictions, especially in cold-start scenarios.
