Gemini is a family of multimodal models developed by Google. It includes different versions such as Gemini 1.5, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Ultra, Pro, and Nano. These models are trained jointly across image, audio, video, and text data to build a model with strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain. In the VERDAD project, Gemini 1.5 is used for transcribing audio and identifying potential misinformation in the transcripts. Gemini 1.5 Pro is a model released by Google that surpassed the capabilities of GPT-4. It introduced significant new features such as a 1 million (later 2 million) token input context length and the ability to process video inputs, making it a notable advancement in the field of AI. Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for robotics, based on Gemini 2.0. It incorporates physical actions as a new output modality to directly control robots, enabling them to perform a wide range of real-world tasks. This model excels in generality, interactivity, and dexterity, allowing it to adapt to various situations, interact seamlessly with users, and execute complex tasks requiring fine motor skills.
