Gemini is a family of multimodal models developed by Google. It includes different versions such as Ultra, Pro, Nano, 1.5 Flash, 1.5 Pro, 2.5, and 2.5 Flash. The models are trained jointly across image, audio, video, and text data to build a model with strong generalist capabilities across modalities alongside cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain. Gemini 1.5 is used in the VERDAD project for transcribing audio and identifying potential misinformation in the transcripts. Gemini 2.0 is an advanced AI model used as the foundation for the AI co-scientist, enabling sophisticated reasoning and collaboration capabilities. Gemini 2.5 is a thinking model, designed to tackle increasingly complex problems. Our first 2.5 model, Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental, leads common benchmarks by meaningful margins and showcases strong reasoning and code capabilities. Gemini 2.5 Flash is an advanced version of the Gemini model series, used as a base model in the AMIE system. This model represents an evolution in capabilities, offering improvements in diagnostic accuracy and management plan appropriateness. Preliminary evaluations suggest that AMIE, when built upon Gemini 2.5 Flash, shows statistically significant gains in key clinical criteria such as Top-3 Diagnosis Accuracy and Management Plan Appropriateness. This indicates the potential for further advancements in the system's performance as the underlying models continue to evolve.
