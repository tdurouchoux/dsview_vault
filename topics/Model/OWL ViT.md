OWL-ViT (Object Detection with Vision Transformer) is a pretrained model used for segmenting camera images to identify and mark individual objects. It operates by flickering objects at different frequencies, allowing the system to detect which object the user is focusing on by synchronizing brainwaves with the flickering frequency. This model is integral to the object selection process in the NOIR system.
