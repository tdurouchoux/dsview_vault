StarCoderBase is the foundational model of StarCoder, trained on a diverse set of 80+ programming languages from The Stack dataset. It serves as the base model that was further fine-tuned on Python-specific data to create StarCoder. StarCoderBase is designed to outperform existing open Code LLMs on popular programming benchmarks and matches or surpasses closed models such as code-cushman-001 from OpenAI.
