StarCoderBase is the foundational model upon which StarCoder is built. It is trained on 80+ programming languages from The Stack dataset and is designed to outperform existing open Code LLMs on popular programming benchmarks. StarCoderBase serves as a base model that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as Python code generation, to create specialized models like StarCoder.
