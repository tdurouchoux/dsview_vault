DeepSeek-R1-Zero is an interim model used in the training process of DeepSeek-R1. It is specialized in reasoning tasks and is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning without the need for a labeled supervised fine-tuning dataset. This model is significant for its ability to automatically verify reasoning problems, making it competitive with other advanced models like OpenAI's O1.
