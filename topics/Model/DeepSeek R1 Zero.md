DeepSeek-R1-Zero is a specialized model within the DeepSeek-R1 framework. It is designed to excel at reasoning tasks without relying on a labeled supervised fine-tuning (SFT) training set. The model undergoes a reinforcement learning (RL) training process directly from a pre-trained base model, making it highly capable in reasoning tasks and competitive with models like OpenAI O1.
