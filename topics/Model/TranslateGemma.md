TranslateGemma is a new collection of open translation models built on Gemma 3, available in 4B, 12B, and 27B parameter sizes. These models are designed to translate across 55 languages with high efficiency and quality. The 12B TranslateGemma model outperforms the Gemma 3 27B baseline, using less than half the parameters, making it highly efficient for high-fidelity translation. The models are optimized for various deployment environments, including mobile, edge, consumer laptops, and cloud-based systems.
