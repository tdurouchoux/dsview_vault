Backstory is an experimental AI tool designed to help users explore the context and origin of images found online. It assesses whether an image is AI-generated, tracks its usage history online, and detects any digital alterations. The tool generates reports based on its findings, providing users with detailed information about the image's provenance and context. Backstory leverages Gemini, a sophisticated AI model, to combine detection technologies with a holistic assessment of the image's context, including metadata and online usage patterns. This tool aims to empower users to make informed decisions about the trustworthiness of images they encounter online.
