Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited for time series prediction. LSTMs use memory cells that can maintain information over long periods of time and have gating mechanisms to control the flow of information. This allows them to learn long-term dependencies and capture complex patterns in sequential data. LSTMs are powerful but require careful hyperparameter tuning and large amounts of data to achieve good results.
