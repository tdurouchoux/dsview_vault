SmolLM2 is a family of compact language models available in three sizes: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters. They are designed to be lightweight enough to run on-device while being capable of solving a wide range of tasks. The models have been trained on a diverse dataset combination, including FineWeb-Edu, DCLM, The Stack, and new mathematics and coding datasets. The instruct version of SmolLM2 supports tasks such as text rewriting, summarization, and function calling.
