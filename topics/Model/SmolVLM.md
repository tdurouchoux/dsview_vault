SmolVLM is a series of Vision Language Models (VLMs) designed for efficient video and image understanding. It includes models with 256M, 500M, and 2.2B parameters, optimized for performance and memory efficiency. These models are particularly robust to prompting, making them suitable for production environments. They excel in tasks such as document question answering, visual reasoning, solving math problems with images, reading text in photos, understanding complex diagrams, and tackling scientific visual questions. They are particularly noted for their performance on video tasks and benchmarks like Video-MME.
