TableFormer is a model developed for table structure recognition, specifically designed to interpret and understand the structure of tables within documents. It is part of the Docling library and is used to integrate tables into the spaCy processing pipeline. TableFormer helps in converting tabular data from documents into a structured format, such as a pandas DataFrame, which can then be used for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
