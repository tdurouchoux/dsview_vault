TableFormer is a model developed for table structure recognition. It is used within the Docling tool to integrate tables into the processing pipeline. Tables are accessible via layout spans and can be represented as pandas.DataFrames, a convenient data structure for storing and manipulating tabular data. This model helps in interpreting tables within documents and making the tabular data more accessible for further processing and analysis.
