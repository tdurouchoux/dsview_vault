DMDE 2026 is a data mining model used by the Caisse d'Allocations Familiales (Caf) in France to help target certain controls. It is designed to identify potential errors in declarations made by beneficiaries, leading to overpayments (indus) or underpayments (rappels). The model uses statistical methods to provide an indicator of risk, which helps prioritize controls but does not make automatic decisions. The decision to conduct a control remains with human agents.
