ModernBERT is a state-of-the-art encoder-only model that represents improvements over older generation encoders. It offers an 8192 sequence length, better downstream performance, and much faster processing. ModernBERT is available in both base (149M params) and large (395M params) model sizes, serving as a slot-in replacement for any BERT-like models. It is designed to be efficient and practical, making it suitable for a wide range of applications such as retrieval, classification, and entity extraction. ModernBERT incorporates modern advancements in transformer architecture, including rotary positional embeddings, GeGLU layers, and optimized hardware design for better performance and efficiency.
