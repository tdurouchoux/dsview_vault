Gemini API models are designed to support both conversational and non-conversational use cases. These models are available through Google AI Studio and Cloud Vertex AI through an easy-to-use API. They make it easy to integrate Gemini API models into any production product or workflow, empowering developers to build applications that can reason across different modalities.
