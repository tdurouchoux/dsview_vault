Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify patterns in data, and express the data in such a way as to highlight their similarities and differences. The main idea is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large number of interrelated variables, while retaining the variation present in the dataset. This is achieved by transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by any projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on. PCA is often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.
