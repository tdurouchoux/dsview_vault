Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) is a research diagnostic conversational AI agent designed to conduct medical diagnostic conversations. It has been enhanced to integrate and interpret multimodal data, such as images and documents, during clinical dialogues. AMIE uses a state-aware reasoning framework to adapt its responses based on the conversation's phase and its evolving understanding of the patient's condition. This allows it to request, interpret, and reason about visual medical information, aiming to provide accurate diagnoses and management plans. The system has been evaluated using simulated patient scenarios and compared with primary care physicians, showing promising results in diagnostic accuracy and management reasoning.
