Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Developed by Google DeepMind and other teams across Google, Gemma is inspired by Gemini, and the name reflects the Latin gemma, meaning “precious stone.” Gemma is available in four sizes: Gemma 1B, Gemma 4B, Gemma 12B, Gemma 27B, Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B, each released with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma models are designed to achieve best-in-class performance for their sizes compared to other open models and are capable of running directly on a developer laptop or desktop computer. Gemma 3, the latest model in the Gemma open-model family, offers advanced capabilities such as multimodality, longer context windows, and improved reasoning and chat functionalities. It integrates a vision encoder for image and video inputs, allowing it to analyze images, answer questions about them, and more. Gemma models adhere to rigorous standards for safe and responsible outputs and are optimized across multiple AI hardware platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs and Google Cloud TPUs. Gemma models were trained using a combination of distillation, reinforcement learning, and model merging techniques.
