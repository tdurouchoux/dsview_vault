Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Developed by Google DeepMind and other teams across Google, Gemma is inspired by Gemini, and the name reflects the Latin gemma, meaning “precious stone.” Gemma is available in four sizes: Gemma 1B, Gemma 2B, Gemma 4B, Gemma 7B, Gemma 12B and Gemma 27B, each released with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. These models are designed to achieve best-in-class performance for their sizes compared to other open models and are capable of running directly on a developer laptop or desktop computer. Gemma models adhere to rigorous standards for safe and responsible outputs, incorporating extensive fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with responsible behaviors. Gemma 3 is an advanced open-model family featuring multimodality, longer context windows, and improved capabilities in math, reasoning, and chat. It supports vision-language input and text outputs and was trained using a combination of distillation, reinforcement learning, and model merging, and it offers both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions.
