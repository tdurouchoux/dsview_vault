Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It is known for its robustness, ability to handle high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting, and provide feature importance metrics.
