An ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random Forests are known for their ability to handle high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting, and provide feature importance metrics. They are robust to overfitting, handle high-dimensional data well, and can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable. They are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in making accurate predictions.
