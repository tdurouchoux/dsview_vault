Codestral Embed is an embedding model specialized for code, designed to excel in retrieval use cases on real-world code data. It outperforms leading code embedders like Voyage Code 3, Cohere Embed v4.0, and OpenAIâ€™s large embedding model. The model can output embeddings with different dimensions and precisions, allowing for a trade-off between retrieval quality and storage costs. It is optimized for high-performance code retrieval and semantic understanding, enabling applications such as retrieval-augmented generation, semantic code search, similarity search, duplicate detection, and semantic clustering.
