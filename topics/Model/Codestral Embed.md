Codestral Embed is an embedding model specialized for code, designed to excel in retrieval use cases with real-world code data. It outperforms leading code embedders like Voyage Code 3, Cohere Embed v4.0, and OpenAIâ€™s large embedding model. The model can generate embeddings with varying dimensions and precisions, allowing users to balance retrieval quality and storage costs. It is particularly optimized for tasks such as retrieval-augmented generation, semantic code search, similarity search, duplicate detection, and semantic clustering, making it highly relevant for AI-powered software engineering and code analysis.
