Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are a type of ensemble learning technique used for regression and classification tasks. They build models in a stage-wise fashion, where each new model attempts to correct the errors of the previous one. Popular implementations include LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, known for their efficiency, speed, and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality. They are particularly effective in time series forecasting due to their ability to handle many features, require little data preprocessing, and provide fast training times.
