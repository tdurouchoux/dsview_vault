ZeroSearch is a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the search capabilities of large language models (LLMs) without requiring interaction with real search engines during training. It uses a simulated search environment to generate both useful and noisy documents, progressively improving the model's reasoning and retrieval abilities through a curriculum-based rollout strategy.
