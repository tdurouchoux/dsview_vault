TimesFM (Time Series Foundation Model) is a pretrained time-series foundation model developed by Google Research for time-series forecasting. It is designed to handle univariate time series forecasting with context lengths up to 2048 timepoints and any horizon lengths, focusing on point forecasts. The model supports optional frequency indicators and experimental quantile heads, although these have not been calibrated post-pretraining. TimesFM is available in multiple checkpoints, including timesfm-1.0-200m and timesfm-2.0-500m, with the latter offering improved performance and longer context lengths.
