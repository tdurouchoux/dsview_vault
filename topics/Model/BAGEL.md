BAGEL is an open-source unified multimodal model designed to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, and possibly other data types. It aims to provide a cohesive framework for handling diverse data inputs, enhancing the capability of AI systems to understand and generate complex, multimodal outputs. This model is particularly useful in applications requiring the fusion of different types of data, such as advanced data analysis, content generation, and interactive AI systems.
