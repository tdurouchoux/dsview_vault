CatBoost is a gradient boosting library that is designed to handle categorical features natively, making it highly efficient for datasets with many categorical variables. It uses ordered target encoding to handle categorical features, which helps in reducing overfitting and improving model performance. CatBoost is known for its ease of use, high performance, and ability to work well out-of-the-box with minimal hyperparameter tuning. It is widely used in various machine learning tasks and competitions.
