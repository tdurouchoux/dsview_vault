An autoencoder is a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning. It is used to learn efficient codings of input data, often for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning. The autoencoder aims to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct its inputs, so that the output is similar to the input. The encoder compresses the input into a lower-dimensional code, and the decoder reconstructs the output from this code. Autoencoders are used to generate patterns, denoise data, and for anomaly detection.
