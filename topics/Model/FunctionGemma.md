FunctionGemma is a specialized version of the Gemma 3 270M model, fine-tuned for function calling. It is designed to enable models to act beyond conversational interfaces, making it suitable for creating custom, fast, private, and local agents that can translate natural language into executable API actions. FunctionGemma can operate as an independent agent for private, offline tasks or as an intelligent traffic controller for larger connected systems, handling common commands at the edge and routing more complex tasks to larger models like Gemma 3 27B.
