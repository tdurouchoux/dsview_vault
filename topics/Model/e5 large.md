The e5-large model is a text embedding model developed by Microsoft that uses weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training to generate high-quality embeddings. The model is trained on a mixture of datasets and can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and text clustering by encoding input text into dense vector representations.
