AMIE, or Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer, is a research diagnostic conversational AI agent developed by Google DeepMind. It is designed to conduct medical diagnostic conversations and has been advanced to include multimodal capabilities, allowing it to interpret and reason about visual medical information. AMIE uses a state-aware reasoning framework to adapt its responses based on the phase of the conversation and its evolving understanding of the patient's condition.
