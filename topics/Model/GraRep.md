An algorithm for learning node representations based on matrix factorization. GraRep is part of the nodevectors library and is particularly useful for capturing high-order proximities between nodes. It uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for matrix factorization and is optimized for performance with parameters like order and embedder.
