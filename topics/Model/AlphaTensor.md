AlphaTensor is an artificial intelligence system developed by DeepMind for discovering novel, efficient, and provably correct algorithms for fundamental tasks such as matrix multiplication. It builds upon AlphaZero, an agent known for superhuman performance in board games like chess, Go, and shogi. AlphaTensor converts the problem of finding efficient matrix multiplication algorithms into a single-player game, using reinforcement learning to identify optimal algorithms. It has discovered algorithms that outperform human-designed ones, improving efficiency in matrix operations, which are crucial in various computational tasks such as image processing, speech recognition, and data compression.
