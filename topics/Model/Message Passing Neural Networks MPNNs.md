Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are graph learning models that compute complex functions over graph data through message passing. This classical approach in GNNs involves nodes receiving messages from their neighbors along incoming edges and updating their own hidden state from these messages. This process is repeated for several rounds, allowing the hidden state of a root node to reflect the aggregate information from all nodes within a certain number of edges. Developed by Justin Gilmer and colleagues, MPNNs have been successfully applied to predict molecular properties and have led to advancements in chemical and biological applications. They represent a flexible and powerful approach to graph learning.
