Whisper is a model developed by OpenAI for speech recognition and transcription. It is designed to convert audio into text with high accuracy, making it suitable for tasks that require precise transcription of spoken language. In the VERDAD project, Whisper is used to generate timestamps for the identified misinformation snippets, providing accurate references to the audio segments for further review and analysis.
