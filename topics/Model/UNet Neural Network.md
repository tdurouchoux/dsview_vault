The UNet neural network is a type of convolutional neural network designed for image processing tasks. It is characterized by its U-shaped architecture, which includes a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. In the context of Stable Diffusion, the UNet neural network is used within the image generator to process and refine image information in the latent space. It works in conjunction with a scheduler to gradually generate high-quality image information from noise.
