Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a type of neural network architecture that serves as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). They are based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which provides a strong mathematical foundation. Unlike MLPs, which have activation functions on nodes, KANs have activation functions on edges. This structural difference often makes KANs more accurate and interpretable than traditional MLPs. KANs are particularly useful in scenarios requiring high accuracy and interpretability, such as scientific computing and certain machine learning tasks.
