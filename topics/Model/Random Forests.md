Random Forests is an ensemble learning method used for classification, regression, and other tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random Forests are known for their ability to handle high-dimensional data, reduce overfitting, and provide feature importance metrics.
