DeepSeek-R1 is an advanced language model designed for reasoning tasks. It is built using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning techniques. The model is notable for its ability to generate long chains of reasoning and excel in solving math and reasoning problems. It is an open weights model with smaller, distilled versions and reflects a training method to reproduce a reasoning model like OpenAI O1.
