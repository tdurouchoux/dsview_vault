A family of efficient convolutional neural networks designed for mobile and edge devices. MobileNet models are optimized for tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation, and are known for their balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. They use depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments.
