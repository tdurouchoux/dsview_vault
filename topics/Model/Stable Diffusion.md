Stable Diffusion is an advanced text-to-image latent diffusion model. It is a system made up of several components and models. It is not one monolithic model. It is a generative model that uses a special kind of neural network called a diffusion model to generate new data that is similar to the training data. The model is trained on large datasets and can produce images with resolutions up to 768x768 pixels. It includes several new features such as depth-to-image synthesis, super-resolution upscaling, and inpainting.
