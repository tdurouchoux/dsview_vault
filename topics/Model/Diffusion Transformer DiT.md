Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is a model that combines diffusion processes with Transformer architecture for tasks such as image generation. It uses a diffusion process to gradually transform random noise into meaningful data, guided by a Transformer network. DiT has shown promise in generating high-quality images and other types of data.
