Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is related to eigen decomposition and can be used to solve systems of linear equations, least squares fitting, and multivariate statistical analysis. The SVD of a matrix A is a factorization of the form A = UΣV*, where U and V are unitary matrices and Σ is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal. The columns of U and V are called the left-singular vectors and right-singular vectors of A, respectively, and the diagonal entries of Σ are known as the singular values of A.
