Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model designed to translate visual information and instructions into motor commands for robots. It enables robots to perform complex tasks by thinking before taking action, showing its process, and learning across different embodiments. Gemini Robotics enhances world understanding, particularly in spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with existing low-level controllers, improving capabilities such as pointing and 3D detection. This model can perform tasks like perception, state estimation, planning, and code generation, achieving higher success rates in controlling robots.
