Gemini Robotics is an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for robotics, based on Gemini 2.0. It introduces physical actions as a new output modality to directly control robots, enabling them to perform a wide range of real-world tasks. This model excels in generality, interactivity, and dexterity, allowing it to adapt to various situations, interact with environments and people, and perform complex tasks requiring precise manipulation.
