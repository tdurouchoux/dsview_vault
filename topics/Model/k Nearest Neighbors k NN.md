k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression. In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k nearest neighbors. In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors.
