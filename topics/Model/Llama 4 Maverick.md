Llama 4 Maverick is a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, designed for advanced multimodal intelligence. It outperforms other models in its class, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, across a broad range of benchmarks. This model offers a best-in-class performance-to-cost ratio and achieves comparable results to DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding tasks. Llama 4 Maverick uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, which enhances its efficiency and performance. It is particularly strong in image and text understanding, making it suitable for sophisticated AI applications that bridge language barriers. The model also features an experimental chat version that scores highly on the LMArena ELO scale.
