Llama 4 Behemoth is a 288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts, representing the most powerful model in the Llama 4 series. It is designed as a teacher model to distill knowledge into smaller models like Llama 4 Scout and Llama 4 Maverick. This model outperforms other leading models such as GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks. Llama 4 Behemoth uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and is still in the training phase, with plans to share more details about its capabilities as it progresses. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance of the smaller Llama 4 models through codistillation.
