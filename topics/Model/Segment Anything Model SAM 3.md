SAM 3 is a unified model designed to detect, segment, and track objects in images and videos based on concept prompts. It supports both image and video segmentation tasks, improving over previous versions by incorporating concept prompts, which can be either short noun phrases, image exemplars, or a combination of both. The model consists of a detector and a tracker that share a single backbone, enhancing detection accuracy and tracking capabilities.
