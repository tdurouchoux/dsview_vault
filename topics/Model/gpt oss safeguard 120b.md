gpt-oss-safeguard-120b is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It is a post-trained model based on the gpt-oss architecture, designed for reasoning from a provided policy to label content under that policy. It is part of the gpt-oss-safeguard series, which includes models like gpt-oss-safeguard-20b. This model is available under the Apache 2.0 license and is compatible with OpenAI's Responses API. It supports full chain-of-thought reasoning, customizable reasoning efforts (low, medium, high), and structured outputs. The model is intended for content classification tasks rather than direct end-user interaction.
