The Transformer is a novel neural network architecture introduced for sequence transduction tasks. It relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions. The model consists of an encoder-decoder structure, where both the encoder and decoder are composed of stacked self-attention and feed-forward layers. The Transformer allows for significant parallelization, leading to faster training times and improved performance on tasks such as machine translation. It has achieved state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and handling sequential data efficiently. Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need' by Vaswani et al. in 2017. They rely heavily on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data, unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that process data sequentially. Transformers are designed to handle tasks involving sequences, such as natural language processing (NLP) and time series analysis. They consist of an encoder and a decoder, both made up of layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of input data differently, enabling it to capture dependencies regardless of their distance in the sequence. This architecture has been highly successful in various applications, including machine translation, text generation, and even image processing when combined with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
