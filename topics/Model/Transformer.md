A type of neural network architecture introduced for sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation. It uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences and has been widely adopted in various NLP tasks due to its effectiveness. The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the paper 'Attention Is All You Need'. It is designed for sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation. The architecture relies entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions. The Transformer model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both composed of stacked self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different input elements dynamically, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The Transformer has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to previous models. Transformer language models are a type of neural network architecture designed for natural language processing tasks. They use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of input data and are particularly effective for tasks like language translation, text generation, and text understanding. In the context of Stable Diffusion, a Transformer language model is used as the text encoder to translate input text into a numeric representation that captures the ideas in the text. This representation is then used by the image generator to produce images based on the text descriptions. The architecture relies entirely on attention mechanisms to draw global dependencies between elements of the input and output. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, both composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The architecture is designed to handle sequential data and has been particularly successful in natural language processing tasks.
