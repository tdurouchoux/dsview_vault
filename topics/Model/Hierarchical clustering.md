Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method that builds a hierarchy of clusters either through a bottom-up approach (agglomerative) or a top-down approach (divisive). It does not require specifying the number of clusters initially and produces a dendrogram to visualize the cluster hierarchy.
