WeatherNext is Google DeepMind's advanced AI model for weather forecasting. It generates hundreds of possible weather scenarios in under a minute using a single TPU, outperforming the previous WeatherNext model on 99.9% of variables and lead times. It uses a Functional Generative Network (FGN) to inject noise directly into the model architecture, ensuring physically realistic and interconnected forecasts. This model is capable of predicting both marginals (individual weather elements) and joints (complex, interconnected systems), making it highly skillful and capable of higher-resolution predictions down to the hour. WeatherNext aims to enhance our understanding of climate change and its impacts, supporting better decision-making in climate and sustainability efforts.
