GraphFC (Graph Neural Networks for Customs Fraud) is a model-agnostic, domain-specific, semi-supervised graph neural network-based algorithm designed for customs fraud detection. It is tailored to handle the scarcity of labeled data, a common challenge in real-world settings, and demonstrates strong semi-supervised and inductive capabilities. The model has shown significant performance improvements, with up to a 252% relative increase in recall over existing state-of-the-art methods, making it highly effective for automating customs fraud detection.
