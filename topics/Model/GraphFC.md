GraphFC (Graph Neural Networks for Customs Fraud) is a model-agnostic, domain-specific, semi-supervised graph neural network-based algorithm designed for customs fraud detection. It is engineered to perform robustly under conditions of label scarcity, making it suitable for real-world settings where labeled data is limited. The model demonstrates strong semi-supervised and inductive capabilities, achieving significant improvements in recall compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
