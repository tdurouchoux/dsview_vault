gpt-oss-safeguard-20b is a medium-sized language model developed by OpenAI. Similar to its larger counterpart, gpt-oss-safeguard-120b, it is a post-trained model based on the gpt-oss architecture. It is designed to reason from a provided policy to classify content under that policy. Available under the Apache 2.0 license, this model is also compatible with OpenAI's Responses API. It supports full chain-of-thought reasoning, customizable reasoning efforts, and structured outputs. The model is optimized for content classification tasks and is not intended for direct end-user interaction.
