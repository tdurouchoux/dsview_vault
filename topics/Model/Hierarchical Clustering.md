Hierarchical Clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. Unlike k-means, this method does not require pre-specifying the number of clusters. There are two types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative (bottom-up) and divisive (top-down). In agglomerative clustering, each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. In divisive clustering, all data points start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy. The result is often visualized as a dendrogram.
