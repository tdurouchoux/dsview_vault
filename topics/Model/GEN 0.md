GEN-0 is a new class of embodied foundation models designed for multimodal training directly on high-fidelity raw physical interaction data. It is built to capture human-level reflexes and physical commonsense, and includes features like Harmonic Reasoning for seamless thinking and acting. The model is trained on a vast dataset of real-world manipulation data and exhibits strong scaling laws, improving predictably with more data and compute.
