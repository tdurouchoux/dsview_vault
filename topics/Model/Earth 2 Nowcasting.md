Earth-2 Nowcasting is a model within the NVIDIA Earth-2 platform that uses generative AI to predict satellite and radar imagery. It delivers high-fidelity, zero- to six-hour hazardous weather forecasts in minutes. This model is notable for being the first AI model to outperform traditional physics-based systems in simulating storm dynamics, providing critical short-term weather predictions.
