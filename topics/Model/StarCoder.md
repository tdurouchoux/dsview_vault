StarCoder is a Large Language Model for Code (Code LLM) trained on permissively licensed data from GitHub, including from 80+ programming languages, Git commits, GitHub issues, and Jupyter notebooks. It is a ~15B parameter model trained for 1 trillion tokens and fine-tuned for 35B Python tokens. StarCoder is designed to outperform existing open Code LLMs on popular programming benchmarks and matches or surpasses closed models such as code-cushman-001 from OpenAI. With a context length of over 8,000 tokens, StarCoder can process more input than any other open LLM, enabling a wide range of applications such as code autocompletion, code modification via instructions, and explaining code snippets in natural language.
