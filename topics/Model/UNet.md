UNet is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for image segmentation tasks. It was introduced in the 2015 paper U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox. The UNet architecture is characterized by its symmetric, U-shaped structure, which consists of a contracting path (encoder) to capture context and a symmetric expanding path (decoder) that enables precise localization. The UNet architecture is widely used in various computer vision tasks, including image segmentation, image generation, and image super-resolution. It is particularly well-suited for tasks where the goal is to generate a high-resolution output from a low-resolution input, or to segment objects in an image.
