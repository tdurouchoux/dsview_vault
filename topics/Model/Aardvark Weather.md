Aardvark Weather is a deep learning model designed for end-to-end data-driven weather forecasting. It ingests observational data from various sources and produces global gridded forecasts and local station forecasts. The model consists of three modules: an encoder module that estimates the initial state of the atmosphere, a processor module that generates forecasts at future lead times, and a decoder module that produces local predictions. Aardvark Weather aims to outperform traditional numerical weather prediction systems by leveraging machine learning techniques.
