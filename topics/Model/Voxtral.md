Voxtral is a state-of-the-art speech understanding model released by Mistral AI. It is available in two sizes: a 24B variant for production-scale applications and a 3B variant for local and edge deployments. The model is designed to provide exceptional transcription, deep understanding, and multilingual fluency. It supports long-form context, built-in Q&A and summarization, natively multilingual capabilities, and function-calling straight from voice. Voxtral is released under the Apache 2.0 license and is also available via an API.
