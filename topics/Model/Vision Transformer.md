A deep learning model that applies the transformer architecture to image data. It processes images by dividing them into patches, which are then linearly embedded and fed into a transformer encoder. Vision transformers have been shown to be effective in various computer vision tasks and are used in state-of-the-art AI weather prediction systems. Vision Transformer (ViT) is notable for its ability to leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies in images.
