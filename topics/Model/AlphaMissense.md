AlphaMissense is an AI model developed by Google DeepMind to predict the pathogenic effects of genetic missense mutations. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze mutations in the genome and assess their potential impact on protein function. AlphaMissense aims to improve our understanding of genetic diseases and contribute to the development of targeted therapies by identifying harmful mutations.
