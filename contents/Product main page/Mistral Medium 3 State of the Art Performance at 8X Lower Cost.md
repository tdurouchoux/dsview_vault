## Summary

Mistral AI introduces Mistral Medium 3, a new language model that balances state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower cost and simpler enterprise deployments. Key highlights include:

- **Performance**: Achieves at or above 90% of Claude Sonnet 3.7's benchmarks at a lower cost ($0.4 input / $2 output per M token).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Outperforms leading open and enterprise models like Llama 4 Maverick and Cohere Command A, while being more cost-effective than DeepSeek v3.
- **Deployability**: Can be deployed on any cloud, including self-hosted environments with four GPUs or more.
- **Enterprise Capabilities**: Supports hybrid or on-premises deployment, custom post-training, and integration into enterprise tools and systems.
- **Professional Use Cases**: Excels in coding, multimodal understanding, and STEM tasks, matching the performance of much larger and slower competitors.
- **Enterprise Adaptability**: Can be continuously pretrained, fully fine-tuned, and integrated into enterprise knowledge bases, making it suitable for domain-specific training and adaptive workflows.
- **Availability**: The Mistral Medium 3 API is available on Mistral La Plateforme and Amazon Sagemaker, with upcoming availability on IBM WatsonX, NVIDIA NIM, Azure AI Foundry, and Google Cloud Vertex.

Mistral AI hints at an upcoming "large" model, suggesting continued innovation and improvements in their model offerings.
