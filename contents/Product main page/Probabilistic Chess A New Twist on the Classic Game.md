## Summary

**Key Points:**

- **Game Concept:** Probabilistic Chess introduces a twist to traditional chess by adding success probabilities to each move, determined by a dice roll.
- **Rules:**
  - Movement success is based on the probability of the destination square.
  - Checkmate does not guarantee a win; the king must be captured.
  - All games end in a win due to the probabilistic nature of the board.
  - Variants include different rules for king moves to balance gameplay.
- **Implementation:**
  - The game is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fast loading and low server costs.
  - The AI combines chess.js and stockfish.js, with an alpha-beta search algorithm and expectation-maximization to consider board probabilities.
  - The AI has limitations due to the slow performance of running a large search tree in JavaScript.
- **Status:** The game is in an experimental 'alpha' version, with ongoing development and room for feedback.
- **Credits:** Created by Marc Stogaitis and Guy Stogaitis, inspired by Cameron Sunâ€™s probabilistic tic-tac-toe.
