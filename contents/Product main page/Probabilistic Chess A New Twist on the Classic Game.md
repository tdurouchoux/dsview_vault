## Summary

Probabilistic Chess is a new variant of chess that introduces success probabilities to each move, blending strategy and unpredictability. Key rules include:

- **Movement Probability**: Each square has a success probability, determined by a dice roll.
- **Winning Condition**: Capturing the opponent's king wins the game, but checkmate doesn't guarantee a win.
- **All Games End in a Win**: Stalemates are impossible due to the probabilistic nature of the board.

Variants of the game include different rules for king moves to balance gameplay. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a chess AI that combines chess.js and stockfish.js. The AI uses an alpha-beta search algorithm with expectation-maximization to consider board probabilities. The game is in an experimental 'alpha' version, with ongoing development and feedback welcome. The project was created by Marc Stogaitis and Guy Stogaitis, inspired by Cameron Sunâ€™s probabilistic tic-tac-toe.
