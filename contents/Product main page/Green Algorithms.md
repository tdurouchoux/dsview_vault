## Summary

The Green Algorithms initiative focuses on promoting environmentally sustainable computational science. It offers tools for researchers to estimate the carbon footprint of their computational projects, including an online calculator and a tool specifically for High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms. The initiative also provides tips for green computing and training materials. Key achievements include winning the 2024 Susannah Boddie Impact of the Year Award and establishing a Community of Practice for Environmentally Sustainable Computational Science. The project is supported by various organizations and all work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
