## Summary

The Green Algorithms project focuses on promoting environmentally sustainable computational science. It offers several tools and resources for researchers, including:

1. **Online Carbon Footprint Calculator**: A tool to estimate the carbon footprint of computations.
2. **Green Algorithms 4 HPC**: A tool to calculate the carbon footprint of computations run on High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms.
3. **Tips for Green Computing**: Resources and guidelines for more sustainable computing practices.
4. **Training Material and Talks**: Educational resources and past talks on the topic.

The project also features a Community of Practice for discussions and a monthly newsletter. It has won the 2024 Susannah Boddie Impact of the Year Award for its significant contributions to raising awareness and providing tools for carbon footprint estimation in computational research. The project is supported by various organizations and all work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
