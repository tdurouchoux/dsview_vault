## Summary

Anthropic has introduced Claude 3.7 Sonnet, a hybrid reasoning model that offers both quick and extended thinking modes, with users controlling the thinking duration. It excels in coding and front-end web development and is available across all Claude plans and platforms. Pricing remains the same as previous models. Claude 3.7 Sonnet integrates reasoning capabilities into a single model, improving performance on tasks like math, physics, and coding. It outperforms other models in real-world coding tasks and benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and TAU-bench. Additionally, Anthropic launched Claude Code, a command-line tool for agentic coding, enabling developers to delegate substantial engineering tasks directly from their terminal. The tool is in a limited research preview and is designed to enhance productivity by automating complex tasks. Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Claude Code represent a step towards AI systems that can deeply reason, work autonomously, and collaborate effectively with humans. The release also includes improvements in safety and reliability, with extensive testing and evaluations conducted to ensure the model meets high standards.
