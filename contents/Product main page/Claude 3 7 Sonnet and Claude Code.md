## Summary

Anthropic has announced Claude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model yet, which combines quick responses with extended, step-by-step thinking. It excels in coding and front-end web development and is available across all Claude plans and major cloud platforms. The model offers fine-grained control over thinking time and maintains the same pricing as its predecessors. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is designed to integrate quick and deep reasoning, improving performance on tasks like math, physics, instruction-following, and coding. It also introduces Claude Code, a command-line tool for agentic coding, available in a limited research preview. Claude 3.7 Sonnet has shown significant improvements in real-world coding tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and TAU-bench. The model has been extensively tested for security, safety, and reliability, with a 45% reduction in unnecessary refusals compared to its predecessor. Anthropic aims to continue improving Claude Code based on user feedback and plans to enhance its capabilities in the coming weeks. The announcement also includes updates on responsible AI practices and future developments in AI systems that augment human capabilities.
