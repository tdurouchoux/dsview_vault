## Summary

The article discusses the emergence of Generative Business Intelligence (GenBI), a new era in business intelligence driven by AI and BI-as-Code. GenBI enables users to interact with data through natural language, generating dashboards, metrics, and data models based on declarative definitions. The key points include:

1. **GenBI Overview**: GenBI leverages AI to make data analytics more accessible, allowing users to create dashboards and query data using conversational language. It relies on a declarative BI stack where dashboards and metrics are defined as code, providing AI with the necessary context to understand and work with data.

2. **Declarative BI Stack**: The declarative approach is crucial for GenBI, as it allows AI models to understand the data model, business metrics, and visualizations. This is facilitated by data modeling languages like LookML, MDX, MAQL, Malloy, and SQL, which define business logic in a structured way.

3. **BI-as-Code**: The evolution from traditional BI to GenBI involves moving from graphical interfaces to code-first approaches. BI-as-Code enables versioning, automation, and separation of business logic from implementation, making it easier to maintain and scale complex dashboards and metrics.

4. **GenAI and Semantic SQL**: GenAI powers GenBI by understanding the semantics behind SQL queries, leveraging the metrics layer and data model to generate visualizations and metrics. Semantic SQL represents business concepts in SQL, making data more accessible to business users.

5. **GenBI Workflow**: A potential GenBI workflow involves using GitHub for version control and collaboration, where humans and AI iterate on prompts to generate and refine dashboards, metrics, and data models. This human-in-the-loop approach ensures accuracy and maintainability.

6. **Core Components**: The core components of GenBI include a BI-as-Code tool, a metrics layer, a natural language interface, an AI engine, and external knowledge sources. These components work together to generate and modify BI artifacts based on user prompts.

7. **Practical Implementation**: Rill Developer is an example of a tool that implements GenBI, allowing users to generate dashboards and metrics based on data sources. It uses AI to create and modify dashboard definitions in code, providing a fast feedback loop for developers.

8. **Future of GenBI**: The future of GenBI holds the promise of faster time-to-insight and democratized access to data analytics. As AI technologies continue to evolve, GenBI is expected to play a significant role in the next generation of business intelligence tools.

The article concludes by highlighting the potential of GenBI to revolutionize the way businesses interact with data, making analytics more accessible and efficient.
