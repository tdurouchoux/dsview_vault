## Summary

The TPC-DS is a decision support benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of hardware, operating systems, and data processing systems under complex, multi-user workloads. It models various aspects of decision support systems, including queries and data maintenance. The benchmark measures query response time in single-user mode, query throughput in multi-user mode, and data maintenance performance. TPC-DS is relevant for emerging technologies like Big Data systems. The Price/Performance metric is expressed as Price/QphDS@Size for Version 2 and Price/kQphDS@Size for Version 3, with the latter adjusted by a multiplier of 1,000 to accommodate industry trends. The current specification is available on the TPC Documentation Webpage.
