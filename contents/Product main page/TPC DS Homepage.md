## Summary

The TPC-DS is a decision support benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of hardware, operating systems, and data processing systems under complex, multi-user workloads. It models various aspects of decision support systems, including queries and data maintenance, and is relevant for emerging technologies like Big Data systems. The benchmark measures query response time in single-user mode, query throughput in multi-user mode, and data maintenance performance. The TPC-DS Price/Performance metric is expressed as Price/QphDS@Size for Version 2 and Price/kQphDS@Size for Version 3, with the latter adjusted by a multiplier of 1,000 to accommodate industry trends. The current specification and additional information about TPC-DS can be found on the TPC Documentation Webpage.
