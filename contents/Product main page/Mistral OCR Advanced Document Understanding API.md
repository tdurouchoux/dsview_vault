## Summary

Mistral OCR is a new Optical Character Recognition API designed for advanced document understanding. It processes images and PDFs, extracting content in an ordered interleaved text and images format, making it suitable for use with RAG systems that handle multimodal documents.

Key features include:
- **State-of-the-art understanding** of complex documents, including tables, equations, and advanced layouts.
- **Multilingual and multimodal** capabilities, supporting thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages.
- **Top-tier benchmarks**, outperforming other leading OCR models in accuracy and speed.
- **Fast processing**, handling up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node.
- **Doc-as-prompt functionality**, allowing for structured output and integration with downstream functions.
- **Self-hosting option** for organizations with stringent data privacy requirements.

Use cases include digitizing scientific research, preserving historical documents, streamlining customer service, and making various types of literature AI-ready. Mistral OCR is available for free trial on le Chat, with API access on la Plateforme and future availability on cloud platforms and on-premises.
