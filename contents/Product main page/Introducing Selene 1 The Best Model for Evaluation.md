## Summary

Atla introduces Selene 1, a state-of-the-art LLM Judge designed for evaluating generative AI responses. Selene 1 outperforms leading models like OpenAI's o-series, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's R1 across 11 benchmarks. It excels in various evaluation tasks such as absolute scoring, classification, and pairwise preference, providing actionable critiques. Selene 1 is highly customizable, responding well to fine-grained steering for specific evaluation criteria. Atla also launches the Eval Copilot in open beta, a tool to help users generate, test, and refine custom evaluation metrics with minimal prompt engineering. Selene 1 and Eval Copilot are available through Atla's API and SDK, with comprehensive documentation and default metrics to facilitate easy integration into existing workflows.
