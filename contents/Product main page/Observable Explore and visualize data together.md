## Summary

Observable is a collaborative data analysis tool designed for teams, enhanced by AI, and supported by a global community of data practitioners. It introduces a collaborative data canvas that allows cross-functional stakeholders to explore data in real-time, fostering data literacy and team-based insights. Key features include:

- **Analyze**: Query, filter, join, group, derive, and visualize data without switching tools.
- **Accelerate**: AI integration to discover insights while maintaining transparency and interpretability.
- **Refine**: Spatial canvas for exploring and refining analysis with annotations and interactive visualizations.
- **Extend**: Flexibility to use point-and-click, AI, or SQL, with the ability to draft and modify queries.
- **Share**: Create and share polished dashboards, embed charts in internal apps, and interact with data through brushing and filtering.

Observable supports various chart types (e.g., Sankeys, beeswarms, bar charts, maps, histograms) and connects to databases like Snowflake, DuckDB, Postgres, and Databricks. It aims to streamline data workflows, enhance collaboration, and make data analysis more accessible and efficient.
