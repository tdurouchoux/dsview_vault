## Summary

Bytebot is an open-source AI desktop agent that operates within a containerized Linux desktop environment, enabling it to use any application, process documents, navigate websites, and complete complex multi-step workflows through natural language commands. It is designed to function like a human, making it universally compatible with any software. Key features include:

- **Task Execution**: Bytebot boots a fresh, sandboxed computer to complete tasks across multiple applications by simulating screen interactions, clicking, and typing through the UI.
- **Scalability**: It can scale from one to hundreds of agents in parallel.
- **Complete Computer Environment**: Comes with a browser, file system, password manager, terminal, code editor, and more, allowing customization and installation of any applications.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: Uses a trackpad, keyboard, and screen to execute clicks, scrolls, and keystrokes with pinpoint accuracy.
- **Graceful Guided Recovery**: Operates on a task until completion or until it needs help, allowing users to take control and resume the agent.
- **History and Logs**: Every action includes screenshots before and after for easy inspection.
- **Open Source & Portable**: Can be run locally with Docker compose, on Railway, or deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Features include sandboxed VMs, optional JWT/secret-key auth, encrypted communications, and audit logs.
- **Parallel & Scalable**: Unlimited agents can tackle hundreds of workflows in parallel without rate-limit issues.

Bytebot supports multiple AI providers, including Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT Models, Google Gemini, and LiteLLM Proxy. It is designed to handle a wide range of tasks such as financial operations, customer onboarding, HR operations, document processing, quality assurance, data entry, and web automation. The tool is completely self-hosted, ensuring data security and control. It integrates seamlessly with existing automation infrastructure and is suitable for enterprise use with strict security requirements. Support is available through comprehensive documentation, GitHub, community discussions, and specialized team consultations. Bytebot is free and open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, with costs limited to AI provider API fees and infrastructure for running Docker containers.
