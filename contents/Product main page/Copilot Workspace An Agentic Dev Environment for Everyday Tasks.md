## Summary

Copilot Workspace is an agentic development environment designed to assist with everyday coding tasks. It uses natural language input to generate a plan of action and implement changes. Key features include:

- **Brainstorming**: Discuss ideas and consider alternatives.
- **Validation**: Test and repair code changes using an integrated terminal.
- **Collaboration**: Share workspaces with team members and create pull requests.
- **Mobility**: Access and manage workspaces from the GitHub mobile app.

Copilot Workspace is powered by GPT-4o and offers steerable interactions, allowing developers to edit specifications and plans. It differs from Copilot and Copilot Chat by focusing on task-oriented development, coordinating changes across multiple files. Users can run and test code within the workspace before creating a pull request, and the environment supports integration with a full IDE via Codespaces.

Access to Copilot Workspace is available to users with a paid Copilot subscription. The technical preview ended on May 30th, 2024.
