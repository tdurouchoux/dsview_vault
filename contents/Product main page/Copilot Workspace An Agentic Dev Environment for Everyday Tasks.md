## Summary

Copilot Workspace is an agentic development environment designed to assist with everyday coding tasks. It uses natural language to understand and implement user intent, offering features like brainstorming, code validation, and collaborative workflows. Powered by GPT-4o, it provides a steerable interface where users can edit specifications and plans, making it easier to evaluate and generate correct code. Unlike Copilot and Copilot Chat, which offer inline suggestions and chat-based interactions, Copilot Workspace focuses on planning and executing coordinated changes across multiple files. Users can run and test code within the workspace before creating pull requests, and it integrates with Codespaces for a full IDE experience. The technical preview ended on May 30th, 2025, and access requires a paid Copilot subscription.
