## Summary

Google DeepMind's Veo is a state-of-the-art video generation model designed to empower filmmakers and storytellers. The latest version, Veo 3, introduces several new features and improvements:

1. **Greater Realism and Fidelity**: Veo 3 offers enhanced realism, including 4K output and improved real-world physics and audio. It also features improved prompt adherence, ensuring more accurate responses to user instructions.

2. **Improved Creative Control**: Veo 3 provides new capabilities for achieving greater control, consistency, and creativity in video generation. This includes the ability to add sound effects, ambient noise, and even dialogue to creations, generating all audio natively.

3. **New Features**: Veo 3 introduces several new features, such as reference-powered video, style matching, character consistency, camera controls, first and last frame creation, outpainting, object addition and removal, character controls, and motion controls.

4. **Safety and Responsibility**: Google DeepMind has built Veo with responsibility and safety in mind. They block harmful requests and results, test new features for safety, and have both internal and external teams trying to find and fix potential problems before release. Veo outputs will be marked with SynthID, a technology for watermarking and detecting AI-generated content, and will undergo safety evaluations and checks for memorized content.

5. **Limitations**: While Veo continues to make strides in video generation, creating videos with natural and consistent spoken audio, particularly for shorter speech segments, remains an area of active development.

6. **Empowering Production Workflows**: Google DeepMind is partnering with various studios and developers to explore how Veo can transform storytelling and production workflows.

7. **Benchmarks**: Veo has achieved state-of-the-art results in head-to-head comparisons of outputs by human raters over top video generation models.

8. **Acknowledgements**: The development of Veo 3 was made possible by key research and engineering contributions from a large team of individuals across Google DeepMind and its partners at Google.
