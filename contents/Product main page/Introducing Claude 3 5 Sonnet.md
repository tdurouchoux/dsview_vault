## Summary

Anthropic has launched Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a new model that outperforms competitors and their previous Claude 3 Opus in intelligence, speed, and cost-efficiency. Key features include:

- **Performance**: Excels in graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate knowledge, and coding proficiency. Operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus.
- **Vision**: Strongest vision model yet, particularly adept at visual reasoning and transcribing text from imperfect images.
- **Artifacts**: New feature allowing real-time interaction and editing of AI-generated content like code snippets and documents.
- **Safety**: Rigorously tested, maintaining ASL-2 safety level. Engaged with external experts for safety evaluations and misuse prevention.
- **Future Plans**: Upcoming releases of Claude 3.5 Haiku and Opus, new modalities, and features like Memory for personalized user experiences.

The model is available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app, with higher rate limits for Claude Pro and Team plan subscribers. It is also accessible via the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, priced at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with a 200K token context window.
