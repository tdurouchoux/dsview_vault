## Summary

ROOST (Robust Open Online Safety Tools) is a nonprofit initiative focused on creating scalable and resilient safety infrastructure for the AI era. It aims to provide open and accessible safety tools to organizations of all sizes, addressing the lack of basic safety resources that hinder innovation and put users at risk.

Key aspects of ROOST include:

- **Child Safety**: Addressing the digital safety gap by providing tools that are often expensive, gate-kept, or challenging to implement.
- **Foundation Model-Powered Content Safeguards**: Collaborating with leading developers to build a community of practice for content safety, identifying and filling critical gaps in training and evaluation datasets.
- **Core Safety Infrastructure**: Developing high-quality, open versions of core tools such as rules engines, case management systems, review consoles, and wrappers for standardized data formats and unified interfaces to different APIs.

ROOST welcomes partnerships, contributions, and collaborations to bridge the digital safety divide. Interested parties can get involved by completing a form on their website.
