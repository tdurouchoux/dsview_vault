## Summary

Mistral AI introduces Devstral 2 and Mistral Vibe CLI, two new tools for coding and automation. Devstral 2 is a state-of-the-art, open-source coding model available in two sizes: Devstral 2 (123B parameters) and Devstral Small 2 (24B parameters). Both models are highly cost-efficient and achieve strong performance on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark. Devstral 2 is free to use via API and supports a 256K context window, making it suitable for production-grade workflows. It can be fine-tuned for specific languages or large enterprise codebases. Devstral Small 2 is designed for local deployment on consumer hardware and supports image inputs for multimodal agents.

Mistral Vibe CLI is an open-source command-line coding assistant powered by Devstral. It provides an interactive chat interface with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution. Key features include project-aware context, smart references, multi-file orchestration, and customizable themes. Vibe CLI can be integrated into preferred IDEs via the Agent Communication Protocol.

Both Devstral 2 and Devstral Small 2 are available for free via API, with pricing set to $0.40/$2.00 per million tokens (input/output) for Devstral 2 and $0.10/$0.30 for Devstral Small 2 after the free period. Mistral AI has partnered with leading open agent tools Kilo Code and Cline to bring Devstral 2 to existing workflows. The tools are optimized for deployment on NVIDIA GPUs, with Devstral Small 2 also supporting CPU-only configurations.
