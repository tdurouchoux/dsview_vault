## Summary

Notion 3.0 introduces AI Agents that can perform tasks like creating documents, building databases, and executing multi-step workflows. These Agents can be personalized with custom instructions and context, and soon, users will be able to create Custom Agents for specific workflows. The update also includes new features like database row permissions, AI connectors, and additional integrations. Notion AI Agents aim to automate busywork, allowing users to focus on more important tasks. The Agents can handle up to 20 minutes of autonomous work, accessing and synthesizing information across various tools. Personalization options include setting instructions for task triage and response formatting, with the ability to refine these settings over time. Custom Agents, set to be released soon, will operate on autopilot and can be shared with teams for specialized tasks.
