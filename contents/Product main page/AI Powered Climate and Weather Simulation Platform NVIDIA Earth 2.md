## Summary

NVIDIA Earth-2 is an open, comprehensive platform designed to democratize access to professional-grade weather and climate AI. It offers a fully open software stack that accelerates every stage of forecasting, from data processing to high-resolution visualization. The platform integrates state-of-the-art architectures and shifts from resource-intensive physics models to an end-to-end AI pipeline, enabling researchers, startups, and government agencies to run, fine-tune, and deploy sophisticated forecasting systems on their own infrastructure with unprecedented speed and cost-efficiency.

Key components of the Earth-2 model family include:

1. **Earth-2 Medium Range**: Delivers high-accuracy predictions for over 70 weather variables up to 15 days in advance, outperforming leading open models like GenCast on key industry benchmarks.

2. **Earth-2 Nowcasting**: Uses generative AI to predict satellite and radar imagery, providing high-fidelity, zero- to six-hour hazardous weather forecasts in minutes. It is the first AI model to outperform traditional physics-based systems in simulating storm dynamics.

3. **Earth-2 Global Data Assimilation (Coming Soon)**: Generates precise initial atmospheric conditions in seconds on GPUs rather than hours on supercomputers. When coupled with Earth-2 Medium Range, it delivers the most skillful forecasting predictions produced by an open, entirely AI pipeline.

4. **Earth-2 CorrDiff**: Enables generative AI downscaling 500x faster with a 10,000x improvement in energy efficiency, augmenting current applications and workflows to generate more datasets for better probabilistic distributions of weather events.

5. **Earth-2 FourCastNet 3**: Accelerates AI-based global weather forecasting, allowing enterprises to develop solutions using datasets that are up to 20x larger, capture extreme weather events while maintaining or boosting energy efficiency.

The platform also includes Earth2Studio, a tool for building, fine-tuning, and deploying Earth-2 open models on users' own infrastructure. Additionally, Earth-2 offers interactive visualization of AI weather forecasts, simulation data, and archived data to analyze extreme weather, and it supports various applications such as carbon capture and storage, urban environment analysis, and extreme weather event prediction.

NVIDIA Earth-2 is supported by a partner ecosystem that includes leading adopters across industries, from energy and finance to global weather agencies, leveraging these open models and tools to transform raw data into actionable insights.
