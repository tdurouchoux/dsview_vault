## Summary

Mistral AI has released Codestral Embed, a state-of-the-art embedding model specialized for code, outperforming leading competitors like Voyage Code 3, Cohere Embed v4.0, and OpenAI’s large embedding model. It offers flexible embedding dimensions and precisions, balancing retrieval quality and storage costs.

Key features and use cases include:
- **Retrieval-augmented generation** for code completion, editing, or explanation.
- **Semantic code search** for finding relevant code snippets from natural language or code queries.
- **Similarity search and duplicate detection** to identify near-duplicate or functionally similar code segments.
- **Semantic clustering and code analytics** for unsupervised grouping of code based on functionality or structure.

Codestral Embed is available via Mistral AI’s API and batch API, with on-prem deployment options. It is optimized for high-performance code retrieval and semantic understanding, making it suitable for AI-powered software engineering tools and developer workflows. Benchmark details and chunking parameters are provided for optimal use.
