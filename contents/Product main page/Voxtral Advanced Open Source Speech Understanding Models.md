## Summary

Mistral AI introduces Voxtral, open-source speech understanding models available in two sizes: 24B for production-scale and 3B for local/edge deployments, both under Apache 2.0 license. Voxtral offers state-of-the-art transcription, deep understanding, multilingual fluency, and flexible deployment. Key features include long-form context (up to 30 minutes for transcription, 40 minutes for understanding), built-in Q&A and summarization, native multilingual support, and function-calling from voice. Voxtral outperforms competitors like Whisper and ElevenLabs Scribe in benchmarks, with cost-efficiency and high accuracy. The models are available for download on Hugging Face and via an API, with pricing starting at $0.001 per minute. Advanced enterprise features include private deployment, domain-specific fine-tuning, and dedicated integration support. Future updates will include speaker segmentation, emotion detection, and non-speech audio recognition. Mistral AI is also hiring to expand its audio team.
