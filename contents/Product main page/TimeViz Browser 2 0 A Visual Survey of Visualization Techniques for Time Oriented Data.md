## Summary

The TimeViz Browser 2.0 is a visual survey tool for exploring techniques in time-oriented data visualization. It categorizes techniques based on several filters:

1. **Time Primitives**: Points or Intervals
2. **Arrangement**: Linear or Cyclic
3. **Data**:
   - Number of variables: Single or Multiple
   - Frame of reference: Abstract or Spatial
4. **Visual Representation**:
   - Mapping of time: Static or Dynamic
   - Dimensionality: 2D or 3D

The tool is based on an open-access book and provides BibTeX citations for academic referencing. It also links to various catalogs of visualization techniques and related books. Maintained by the Visual Analytics Group at the University of Rostock, Germany, the tool aims to assist users in finding relevant visualization techniques for time-oriented data.
