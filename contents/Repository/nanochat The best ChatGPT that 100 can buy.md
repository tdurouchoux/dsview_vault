## Summary

The nanochat repository, created by Andrej Karpathy, is a full-stack implementation of a lightweight LLM similar to ChatGPT. It is designed to be minimal, hackable, and dependency-lite, running on a single 8XH100 node. The project includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI.

Key features include:
- **Quick Start**: The `speedrun.sh` script trains and infers a $100 tier model in about 4 hours on an 8XH100 GPU node.
- **Bigger Models**: Instructions are provided for training larger models, such as a $300 tier and a $1000 tier, though these are not fully supported in the master branch.
- **Computing Environments**: The code can run on various GPU configurations, with adjustments needed for memory constraints.
- **Questions and Tests**: The repository includes utilities for packaging files to ask questions and basic tests, particularly for the tokenizer.
- **Contributing**: The project aims to improve micro models accessible on budgets under $1000, emphasizing simplicity and hackability.

The repository is licensed under MIT and includes acknowledgments to various contributors and resources.
