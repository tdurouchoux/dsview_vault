## Summary

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit designed for building, evaluating, and deploying AI agents with flexibility and control. Key features include:

- **Rich Tool Ecosystem**: Utilizes pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs for diverse agent capabilities.
- **Code-First Development**: Defines agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for flexibility and testability.
- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Allows designing scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
- **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol**: Integrates with the A2A protocol for remote agent-to-agent communication.

The toolkit is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem but compatible with other frameworks. It supports both stable and development versions for installation via pip. The documentation provides detailed guides on building, evaluating, and deploying agents. Contributions from the community are welcome, with guidelines available for bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions. The project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
