## Summary

WAT is a Python inspection tool designed to help explore and understand unknown objects at runtime. It provides detailed information about an object's type, value, variables, methods, parent types, signature, documentation, and source code. The tool can be used in a Python interpreter or integrated into a script. Key features include various modifiers to customize the output, such as hiding attributes, showing dunder attributes, displaying source code, and more. WAT can inspect a wide range of objects, including data structures, functions, classes, modules, and built-in types. It is particularly useful for debugging, learning Python, and exploring modules and their contents. The tool can be installed via pip or loaded directly into a Python session using an Insta-Load snippet. WAT also supports environment variables for customizing the output, such as disabling colorful output or setting a custom color theme.
