## Summary

Markwhen is an interactive text-to-timeline tool that converts markdown-like text into a cascading timeline. It supports various date styles, images, links, locations, and more. The project is divided into several repositories under the mark-when organization, with the web app (editor) being the only non-open-source component. Key components include:

1. **Editor**: Available at markwhen.com, allows users to create and edit timelines.
2. **VSCode Extension**: Enables timeline creation and editing within Visual Studio Code.
3. **View Container**: Renders different views like timeline, calendar, and resume. Users can create custom views using the view client library.
4. **Parser**: Converts markdown-like text into timeline data.
5. **Views**: Includes timeline, calendar, resume, and Vue view template.

The project can be set up locally using npm or Docker. Documentation and additional resources are available on the markwhen website. The code is primarily written in HTML, Vue, and TypeScript.
