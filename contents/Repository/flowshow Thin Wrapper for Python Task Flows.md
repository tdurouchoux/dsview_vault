## Summary

Flowshow is a lightweight Python library designed to track and visualize the execution of Python functions as a flow. It provides a `@task` decorator and a `span` context manager to help monitor and log the execution of tasks. Key features include:

- **Task Decorator**: Marks functions to be tracked and visualized.
- **Span Context Manager**: Allows for nested tracking of code execution.
- **Logging Utilities**: Includes functions like `info`, `warning`, and `add_artifacts` for logging and artifact management.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Supports retrying tasks on specific exceptions with configurable attempts.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of the program's flow, aiding in debugging and refactoring.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Works well with interactive notebooks for better visualization and debugging.

The library is easy to install via `uv pip install flowshow` and integrates seamlessly into existing Python code. It is particularly useful for tracking the execution flow of complex tasks and debugging purposes.
