## Summary

Flowshow is a lightweight Python library designed to track and visualize the execution of Python functions as a flow. It provides a `@task` decorator and a `span` context manager to help monitor and log the execution of tasks. Key features include:

- **Task Decorator**: Marks functions to be tracked and visualized.
- **Span Context Manager**: Allows for nested tracking and logging within functions.
- **Logging Utilities**: Includes functions like `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `add_artifacts` for logging and artifact management.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Supports retrying tasks on specific exceptions with configurable attempts.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual representations of the program flow, aiding in debugging and refactoring.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Works well with interactive notebooks for enhanced usability.

The library is installed via `uv pip install flowshow` and is licensed under the MIT license. It is particularly useful for debugging and understanding the flow of Python programs.
