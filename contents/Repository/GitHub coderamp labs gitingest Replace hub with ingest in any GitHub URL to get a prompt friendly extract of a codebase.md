## Summary

Gitingest is a tool that transforms Git repositories into text extracts suitable for large language models (LLMs). Key features include easy code context extraction, smart formatting for LLM prompts, and statistics about file structure, size, and token count. It is available as a CLI tool, Python package, and browser extension. Installation is straightforward via pip or pipx. The tool supports both public and private repositories, with the latter requiring a GitHub Personal Access Token. It can be self-hosted using Docker, with configurations managed via environment variables. The project encourages community contributions and provides detailed guidelines for both technical and non-technical contributions. The stack includes Tailwind CSS, FastAPI, Jinja2, tiktoken, PostHog, and Sentry.
