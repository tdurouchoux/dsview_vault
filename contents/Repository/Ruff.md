## Summary

Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It is designed to be orders of magnitude faster than existing tools like Flake8, Black, and isort, with a focus on integrating more functionality behind a single interface. Key features include:

- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than existing linters and formatters.
- **Compatibility**: Drop-in parity with Flake8, isort, and Black.
- **Built-in Caching**: Avoids re-analyzing unchanged files.
- **Fix Support**: Automatic error correction, such as removing unused imports.
- **Over 800 Rules**: Includes native re-implementations of popular Flake8 plugins.
- **Editor Integrations**: First-party support for VS Code and more.
- **Monorepo-Friendly**: Hierarchical and cascading configuration.

Ruff is actively developed and used in major open-source projects like Apache Airflow, FastAPI, and Pandas. It is backed by Astral and aims to replace multiple tools with a single, fast solution. Testimonials highlight its speed and efficiency, with users reporting significant time savings and improved development workflows.
