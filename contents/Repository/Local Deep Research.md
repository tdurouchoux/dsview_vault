## Summary

Local Deep Research (LDR) is an AI-powered research assistant designed for deep, iterative research. It achieves ~95% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark using GPT-4.1-mini and supports both local and cloud-based large language models (LLMs) like Ollama, Google, and Anthropic. LDR can search over 10 sources, including arXiv, PubMed, web, and private documents, all while maintaining a local focus.

Key features include:
- **Research Modes**: Quick summaries, detailed research, report generation, and document analysis.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: LangChain integration, REST API, benchmarking, analytics dashboard, real-time updates, and export options.
- **Security & Privacy**: Signal-level encryption, per-user isolated databases, zero-knowledge architecture, and advanced key derivation.
- **Search Sources**: Supports free search engines (arXiv, PubMed, Wikipedia, etc.) and premium engines (Tavily, Google, Brave Search), as well as custom sources like local documents and LangChain retrievers.
- **Quick Start**: Options include Docker, Docker Compose, and Python package installation.
- **Usage Examples**: Provides Python API, HTTP API, and command-line tools for various research tasks.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Connects to existing knowledge bases using LangChain-compatible retrievers.
- **Performance & Analytics**: Includes benchmark results and a built-in analytics dashboard.
- **Supported LLMs**: Local models via Ollama (Llama 3, Mistral, Gemma, DeepSeek) and cloud models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).

LDR is open-source under the MIT license and includes comprehensive documentation and community support.
