## Summary

Local Deep Research (LDR) is an AI-powered research assistant designed for deep, iterative research. It achieves ~95% accuracy on the SimpleQA benchmark when tested with GPT-4.1-mini and supports both local and cloud-based large language models (LLMs) like Ollama, Google, and Anthropic. LDR can search across multiple sources, including arXiv, PubMed, web, and private documents, all while maintaining a local focus.

Key features of LDR include:
- **Research Modes**: Quick summaries, detailed research, report generation, and document analysis.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: LangChain integration, REST API, benchmarking, analytics dashboard, real-time updates, export options, research history, adaptive rate limiting, keyboard shortcuts, and per-user encrypted databases.
- **Search Sources**: Supports free search engines (arXiv, PubMed, Wikipedia, etc.), premium search engines (Tavily, Google, Brave Search), and custom sources (local documents, LangChain retrievers, meta search).

LDR is privacy-focused, flexible, comprehensive, transparent, and open-source under the MIT license. It offers multiple installation options, including Docker, Docker Compose, and Python package installation. The tool also provides various usage examples through Python API, HTTP API, and command-line tools.

Performance metrics show preliminary results with configurations like gpt-4.1-mini + SearXNG achieving 90-95% accuracy. LDR supports a wide range of LLMs, both local (via Ollama) and cloud-based (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). Detailed documentation and community support are available to help users get started and contribute to the project.
