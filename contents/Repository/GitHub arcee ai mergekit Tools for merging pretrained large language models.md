## Summary

MergeKit is a toolkit for merging pre-trained language models, designed to combine the strengths of different models without the need for additional training. It supports various merging algorithms and can operate on both CPU and GPU with as little as 8 GB of VRAM. Key features include support for multiple model architectures, lazy loading of tensors for low memory use, and various merge methods such as linear interpolation, spherical linear interpolation (SLERP), task arithmetic, and more. The toolkit also allows for the extraction of low-rank adaptations (LoRA) and supports mixture of experts merging. MergeKit provides a flexible configuration system via YAML files, enabling detailed control over the merging process, including parameter specification, tokenizer configuration, and chat template configuration. It also offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use. The toolkit is open-source and can be installed via pip. MergeKit is designed to be extensible, with the ability to add new merge methods as they become available. The project is actively maintained and welcomes contributions from the community.
