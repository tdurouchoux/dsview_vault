## Summary

Scrapling is a Python library designed for web scraping, emphasizing undetectability, power, flexibility, and high performance. It introduces adaptive scraping, which learns from website changes and evolves with them, unlike other libraries that break when websites update their structure. Key features include advanced website fetching with session support, dynamic loading, anti-bot bypass, and async support. It also offers adaptive scraping with AI integration, high-performance architecture, and a developer-friendly experience with an interactive web scraping shell and rich navigation API. The library supports various selection methods like CSS selectors, XPath, and text search. It is optimized for speed and memory efficiency, outperforming many other Python scraping libraries. Scrapling requires Python 3.10 or higher and can be installed via pip. Additional features include an MCP server for AI-assisted scraping and a command-line interface for direct scraping without coding. The project is open-source under the BSD-3-Clause license and welcomes contributions.
