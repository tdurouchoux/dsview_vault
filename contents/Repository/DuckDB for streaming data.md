## Summary

SQLFlow is a high-performance stream processing engine that allows users to define data pipelines using SQL. It is built on DuckDB and Apache Arrow for high-speed processing and supports various input sources like Kafka and WebSockets, and output sinks like PostgreSQL, Kafka, and cloud storage in formats such as Parquet and Iceberg.

Key features include:
- Processing data from multiple sources.
- Writing outputs to various destinations in different formats.
- High-speed processing with DuckDB and Apache Arrow.
- Support for streaming data transformations, enrichment, aggregation, and more.

SQLFlow's architecture consists of three main components:
1. **Input Source**: Ingests data from various sources.
2. **Handler**: Executes SQL against the input source using DuckDB and Apache Arrow.
3. **Output Sink**: Writes the results to different output sources.

The tool supports a range of use cases, including streaming data transformations, stream enrichment, data aggregation, tumbling window aggregation, and more. It also provides observability metrics and supports user-defined functions (UDFs) and dynamic schema inference.

Performance benchmarks show high throughput and efficient memory usage for different test scenarios, such as simple aggregation, enrichment, and CSV joins.

For more detailed information, users can refer to the tutorials and example configurations provided in the repository.
