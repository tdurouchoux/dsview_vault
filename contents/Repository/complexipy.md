## Summary

**complexipy** is a tool for measuring cognitive complexity in Python code, focusing on human understanding rather than machine readability. It helps identify complex code that needs refactoring, improving code reviews and maintenance.

**Key Features:**
- **Installation**: Available via pip or uv.
- **Usage**: Can be used via command line or Python API.
- **Configuration**: Supports TOML files for custom settings.
- **Integrations**: Compatible with GitHub Actions, pre-commit hooks, and VS Code.
- **Snapshot Baselines**: Useful for large codebases to track and manage complexity over time.
- **Inline Ignores**: Allows ignoring specific functions with inline comments.

**Technical Details:**
- Measures cognitive complexity, which considers mental effort to understand code.
- Provides actionable insights to improve code quality.
- Supports various output formats (JSON, CSV) and custom thresholds.
- Includes API reference for programmatic use.

**Use Cases:**
- Code reviews to identify complex code.
- Maintaining clean and understandable codebases.
- Integrating into CI/CD pipelines for automated complexity checks.
