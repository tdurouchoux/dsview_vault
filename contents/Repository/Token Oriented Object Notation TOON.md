## Summary

Token-Oriented Object Notation (TOON) is a compact, human-readable format designed for LLM prompts, offering a schema-aware, JSON-compatible representation. It combines YAML's indentation with CSV-style tabular layouts, excelling with uniform arrays of objects. TOON is token-efficient, reducing token usage by ~40% compared to JSON while maintaining high accuracy. It supports explicit schema definitions and is compatible with various programming languages. The format is ideal for LLM inputs but may not be suitable for deeply nested or non-uniform data. Benchmarks show TOON's superior token efficiency and accuracy across different datasets and models. TOON is supported by a TypeScript SDK, CLI tools, and editor plugins, with implementations available in multiple languages. The project is open-source under the MIT license.
