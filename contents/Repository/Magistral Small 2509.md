## Summary

Magistral Small 1.2 is an efficient reasoning model with 24B parameters, built upon Mistral Small 3.2. It features multimodal capabilities, including a vision encoder for analyzing images, and supports 24 languages. The model is designed to fit within a single RTX 4090 or a 32GB RAM MacBook once quantized. Key updates include improved performance, better tone and persona, and the introduction of special think tokens for easier parsing of reasoning traces. The model is licensed under Apache 2.0, allowing for both commercial and non-commercial use. Benchmark results show significant improvements over previous versions, particularly in reasoning and multilingual tasks. The recommended sampling parameters are top_p: 0.95, temperature: 0.7, and max_tokens: 131072. The model can be used with various frameworks, including vLLM (recommended), Transformers, llama.cpp, and others. The model is based on the Mistral Small 3.1-24B-Base-2503 and has been fine-tuned to improve its reasoning capabilities.
