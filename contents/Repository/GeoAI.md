## Summary

GeoAI is a Python package that integrates AI with geospatial data analysis, offering tools for processing satellite imagery, aerial photographs, and vector data using deep learning models. It provides five core capabilities: interactive data search and download, automated dataset preparation, model training, inference pipelines, and interactive visualization. Key features include advanced geospatial data visualization, data preparation and processing, image segmentation, image classification, and additional capabilities like change detection and object detection. The package supports multiple data formats and includes a QGIS plugin for seamless integration. GeoAI is designed to be user-friendly, lowering barriers for geospatial researchers, AI practitioners, and educators. It is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, and supported by organizations like NASA and AmericaView.
