## Summary

The repository provides a collection of PyTorch implementations of various deep learning algorithms and neural networks, accompanied by detailed explanations. The implementations are rendered as side-by-side formatted notes on the labml.ai website. The repository is actively maintained and updated weekly with new implementations.

Key topics covered include:

1. **Transformers**: Various types and components of transformers, such as multi-headed attention, Transformer XL, Vision Transformer (ViT), and more.
2. **Optimizers**: Different optimization algorithms like Adam, AdaBelief, and Sophia-G.
3. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Implementations of original GAN, Cycle GAN, StyleGAN 2, and others.
4. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q Networks (DQN).
5. **Normalization Layers**: Techniques such as Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, and Group Normalization.
6. **Other Models and Techniques**: Includes implementations of ResNet, Capsule Networks, U-Net, Graph Neural Networks, and more.

The repository is designed to help users understand these algorithms better through practical implementations and detailed documentation. It is available under the MIT license and can be installed via pip.
