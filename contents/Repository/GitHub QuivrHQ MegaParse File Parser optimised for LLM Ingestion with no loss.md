## Summary

MegaParse is an open-source file parser designed for optimal ingestion by Large Language Models (LLMs). It supports various file types including PDFs, DOCX, and PPTX, with a focus on preserving all information during parsing. Key features include versatility, speed, and compatibility with text, tables, headers, footers, and images. Installation requires Python 3.11 or higher and additional tools like poppler and tesseract. MegaParse can be used directly, with its Vision module for multimodal models, or as an API. Benchmarks show it outperforms other parsers in similarity ratio. Ongoing improvements include table checking and structured output. The project is actively maintained with frequent releases and contributions from multiple developers.
