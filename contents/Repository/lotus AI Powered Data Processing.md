## Summary

LOTUS is a framework for AI-powered data processing that leverages LLMs and embeddings to process both structured and unstructured data. It offers a Pandas-like API and provides semantic operators for tasks such as mapping, filtering, extracting, aggregating, and joining data based on natural language expressions. LOTUS aims to provide up to 1000x speedups with accurate query processing and supports various models from LiteLLM and SentenceTransformers. The framework is designed to be modular, allowing for high-level logic while leaving optimizations to the query engine. Installation can be done using uv or pip, with additional setup required for Mac users. Tutorials and documentation are available to help users get started. The project welcomes community contributions and has a community Discord and email for support.
