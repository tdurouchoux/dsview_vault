## Summary

OS-Copilot is an open-source library designed to create generalist agents that can interact with various elements of an operating system, including web browsers, code terminals, files, multimedia, and third-party applications. The project aims to develop self-improving embodied conversational agents that can automate daily tasks.

Key features and updates include:
- Integration with vision capabilities (as of 2024.9).
- A front-end interface for easier interaction (as of 2024.6).
- Acceptance at the LLM Agents Workshop at ICLR 2024 (as of 2024.3).

The project provides a quick start guide for setting up the environment and running a basic demonstration. It also offers tutorials for different skill levels, ranging from installation and basic usage to advanced topics like designing new API tools.

The user interface is designed to enhance the experience with an intuitive frontend. The community is encouraged to join discussions on Discord and follow updates on Twitter. Contributions are welcome, and a roadmap is available for those interested in contributing.
