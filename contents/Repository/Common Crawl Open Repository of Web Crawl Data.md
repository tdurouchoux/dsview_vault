## Summary

Common Crawl is a non-profit organization that maintains a free, open repository of web crawl data, accessible to researchers and the public. Founded in 2007, it contains over 300 billion web pages spanning 15 years, with 3-5 billion new pages added monthly. The data has been cited in over 10,000 research papers. Key features include:

- **Data Overview**: Massive corpus of web data, freely available since 2007.
- **Research Papers**: Highlights studies using Common Crawl data, such as geolocating news articles, analyzing web crawler refusals, and studying censorship.
- **Use Cases**: Examples include enhancing computational analysis, improving language models, and creating backlink databases.
- **Community**: Offers resources like a blog, mailing list, Discord, and Hugging Face for collaboration and support.
- **Impact**: Supports research in various domains, including natural language processing, web science, and digital libraries.

The organization also provides tools and documentation to help users get started with the data.
