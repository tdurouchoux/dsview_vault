## Summary

Devstral Small 1.0 is an agentic LLM designed for software engineering tasks, developed through a collaboration between Mistral AI and All Hands AI. It is fine-tuned from Mistral-Small-3.1, featuring a 128k token context window and a compact size of 24 billion parameters, making it suitable for local deployment. Key features include agentic coding capabilities, a lightweight architecture, an Apache 2.0 license, and a 128k context window with a 131k vocabulary size tokenizer.

The model achieves a score of 46.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming prior open-source state-of-the-art models by 6%. It is recommended to use Devstral with the OpenHands scaffold, which can be accessed via an API or deployed locally using various libraries such as vLLM, Mistral-inference, Transformers, LMStudio, llama.cpp, and Ollama. The model can be used to build applications like a To-Do list app and analyze test coverage in repositories. Detailed instructions are provided for setting up and using the model with each of these libraries.
