## Summary

Skyulf is a self-hosted MLOps platform designed for teams needing to keep data on-premise due to privacy or compliance reasons. It offers a visual canvas for data cleaning and feature engineering, background training powered by Polars and Celery, and one-click deployment via a built-in REST API. Key features include data ingestion without leaving the network, exploratory data analysis with automated profiling and causal discovery, feature engineering with drag-and-drop nodes, experiment tracking, local inference for model validation, and continuous monitoring for drift detection. The platform is built on modern open-source tools like Scikit-learn, Pandas, FastAPI, and Polars. It is particularly suited for healthcare, government, and small teams, offering GDPR and HIPAA-friendly workflows. Skyulf is open-source with a split license model (Apache 2.0 for the backend and GNU AGPLv3 for the frontend), aiming to democratize AI development with a future "App Hub" for creating AI tools.
