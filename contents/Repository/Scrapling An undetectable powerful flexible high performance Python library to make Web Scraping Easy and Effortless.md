## Summary

Scrapling is a Python library designed for web scraping, emphasizing ease of use, performance, and adaptability. It offers several key features:

1. **Advanced Fetching**: Supports various fetching methods, including stealthy and dynamic fetching to bypass anti-bot systems like Cloudflare's Turnstile. It also supports session management for persistent cookies and state across requests.

2. **Adaptive Scraping**: Uses intelligent algorithms to relocate elements after website changes, ensuring scrapers remain functional even when website structures update.

3. **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and memory efficiency, outperforming many other Python scraping libraries. It includes fast JSON serialization and lazy loading for minimal memory footprint.

4. **Developer-Friendly**: Offers an interactive shell for quick development, rich navigation APIs, and auto-selector generation. It also provides full type hints for better IDE support.

5. **Async Support**: Supports asynchronous operations across all fetchers and sessions, allowing for concurrent requests and efficient resource management.

6. **AI Integration**: Includes an MCP server for AI-assisted scraping, reducing token usage and speeding up operations.

7. **CLI Tools**: Provides command-line tools for quick scraping tasks without writing code, including an interactive shell and direct URL scraping.

8. **Installation**: Requires Python 3.10 or higher and offers optional dependencies for additional features like the MCP server and shell tools.
