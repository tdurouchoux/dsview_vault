## Summary

Ultralytics YOLO is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) computer vision and AI framework that offers fast, accurate, and easy-to-use models for various tasks such as object detection, tracking, instance segmentation, image classification, and pose estimation. The framework is constantly updated for performance and flexibility.

### Key Features:
- **Models**: Ultralytics supports a wide range of YOLO models, from YOLOv3 to the latest YOLO11, pretrained on datasets like COCO and ImageNet.
- **Tasks**: The models are designed for tasks like detection, segmentation, classification, pose estimation, and oriented bounding boxes (OBB).
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed metrics are provided for each model, including mAP (mean Average Precision), speed, parameters, and FLOPs.
- **Installation and Usage**: The framework can be installed via pip and used through a Command Line Interface (CLI) or integrated into Python projects.
- **Integrations**: Ultralytics integrates with platforms like Weights & Biases, Comet ML, Roboflow, and Intel OpenVINO to enhance AI workflows.
- **Ultralytics HUB**: An all-in-one platform for data visualization, training, and deployment of YOLO models without requiring coding.
- **Contributions**: The project encourages community contributions and provides guidelines for contributing.
- **Licensing**: Offers both AGPL-3.0 (open-source) and Enterprise licenses for commercial use.

### Usage Examples:
- **CLI**: `yolo predict model=yolo11n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'`
- **Python**: `from ultralytics import YOLO; model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt"); results = model("path/to/image.jpg")`

### Support and Community:
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guidance is available in the Ultralytics Docs.
- **Support**: Issues can be reported on GitHub, and discussions can be joined on Discord, Reddit, and the Ultralytics Community Forums.

Ultralytics YOLO is designed to be user-friendly and highly performant, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in computer vision and AI.
