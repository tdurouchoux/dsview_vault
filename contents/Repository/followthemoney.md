## Summary

FollowTheMoney (FtM) is a data model designed for financial crime investigations and document forensics. It defines entities relevant to such research (e.g., people, companies) and provides tools to generate, validate, and export data. Entities can reference each other, creating a graph of relationships. The ontology also includes a model for various types of evidentiary documents.

Key use cases include:
- Core data model for software like OpenAleph (data platform) and yente (sanctions compliance screening engine).
- Data exchange format for structured datasets between systems.
- ETL pipeline tooling for data cleaning and normalization.
- SDK for creating scripts and applications for investigative data analysis.

FtM is an open-source project under the MIT License, maintained by OpenSanctions.
