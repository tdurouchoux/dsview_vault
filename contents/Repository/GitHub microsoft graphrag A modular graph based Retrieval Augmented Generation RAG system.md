## Summary

GraphRAG is a modular, graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed by Microsoft. It is designed to extract structured data from unstructured text using large language models (LLMs). The system enhances LLM outputs by utilizing knowledge graph memory structures.

Key features and guidelines include:

- **Quickstart**: The repository provides a command-line quickstart for initial setup.
- **Repository Guidance**: The code is a demonstration and not an officially supported Microsoft offering. Users are warned about the potential costs of GraphRAG indexing.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Fine-tuning prompts is recommended for optimal results.
- **Versioning**: Users should run specific commands between version updates to ensure compatibility and avoid re-indexing.
- **Responsible AI**: The project includes a Responsible AI FAQ addressing usage, evaluation, limitations, and operational factors.
- **Trademarks and Privacy**: The project adheres to Microsoft's trademark and privacy guidelines.

The repository includes documentation for contributing, developing, and using the system, as well as a link to the Microsoft Research Blog Post for more detailed information.
