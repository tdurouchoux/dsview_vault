## Summary

GraphRAG is a modular, graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system developed by Microsoft. It is designed to extract structured data from unstructured text using large language models (LLMs). The system enhances LLM outputs by leveraging knowledge graph memory structures. Key points include:

- **Purpose**: Extracts meaningful, structured data from unstructured text.
- **Modularity**: The system is modular, allowing for flexible integration and customization.
- **Quickstart**: Provides a command-line quickstart for easy initiation.
- **Prompt Tuning**: Recommends fine-tuning prompts for better results.
- **Versioning**: Includes guidelines for versioning and migration to avoid re-indexing.
- **Responsible AI**: Addresses ethical considerations and provides a FAQ for responsible use.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is available, including a Microsoft Research Blog Post and an Arxiv paper.

The repository serves as a demonstration and is not an officially supported Microsoft offering. Users are advised to start small due to the potential costs of indexing.
