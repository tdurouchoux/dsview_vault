- **Visualization**: Can generate charts and visualizations based on user queries.
- **Docker Sandbox**: Provides a secure, isolated environment for executing code, enhancing security.
- **Integration**: Can be used in Jupyter notebooks, Streamlit apps, or via a client-server architecture.

**Installation and Usage**:
- Requires Python 3.8+ (excluding 3.12).
- Install via pip or poetry.
- Configure with an LLM (e.g., OpenAI) and use the `chat` method to interact with DataFrames.

**Security and Contribution**:
- Offers a Docker sandbox for secure code execution.
- Open-source under the MIT license, with contributions welcome.
