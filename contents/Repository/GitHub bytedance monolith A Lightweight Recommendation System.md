## Summary

Monolith is a deep learning framework for large-scale recommendation systems, built on TensorFlow. It introduces two key features:

1. **Collisionless Embedding Tables**: Ensures unique representations for different ID features.
2. **Real-Time Training**: Captures the latest trends and helps users discover new interests rapidly.

The framework supports both batch and real-time training and serving. It is primarily developed in Python and C++, with some Starlark, Go, Shell, Dockerfile, and Makefile components. The project includes a demo and tutorials for distributed async training and using the MonolithModel API. The source code can be compiled on Linux using Bazel 3.1.0, and a Python environment with specific dependencies is required for building and running the framework.
