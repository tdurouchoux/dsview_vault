## Summary

Prompt engineering is a new discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively use language models (LMs) across various applications and research areas. It helps understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on tasks like question answering and arithmetic reasoning, while developers use it to create robust techniques for interacting with LLMs and other tools.

This guide covers the basics of prompts, providing an overview of how to use them to interact with and instruct LLMs. Examples are tested with text-davinci-003 using OpenAI's playground, with default settings (temperature=0.7, top-p=1).

Key sections include:
- Basic principles of prompting
- Elements of a prompt
- General tips for prompt design
- Examples of prompts
- Various techniques like zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and more
- Applications such as data generation, coding, sentiment classification, and more
- Models like ChatGPT, LLaMA, GPT-4, and others
- Risks and misuse, including contradictory incentives, factuality, and biases
- LLM research findings and tools

The guide also mentions additional resources like courses, guides, and research papers on prompt engineering and related topics.
