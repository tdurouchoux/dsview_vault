## Summary

LangExtract is a Python library designed for extracting structured information from unstructured text using large language models (LLMs). It offers precise source grounding, reliable structured outputs, and interactive visualization. Key features include:

- **Precise Source Grounding**: Maps extractions to exact locations in the source text.
- **Reliable Structured Outputs**: Enforces consistent output schema based on user-defined examples.
- **Optimized for Long Documents**: Uses text chunking, parallel processing, and multiple passes for higher recall.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates an interactive HTML file for easy review of extracted entities.
- **Flexible LLM Support**: Compatible with cloud-based models like Google Gemini and local open-source models via Ollama.
- **Adaptable to Any Domain**: Can be used for various domains without requiring model fine-tuning.

The library supports custom model providers and offers detailed examples for tasks such as extracting information from literary texts, medical records, and radiology reports. Installation is straightforward via PyPI, and the library includes comprehensive documentation and community support.
