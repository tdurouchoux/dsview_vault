## Summary

Corese is a software platform for the Semantic Web, implementing and extending standards like RDF, RDFS, SPARQL 1.1, OWL RL, and SHACL. It also includes extensions such as STTL SPARQL, SPARQL Rule, and LDScript. The platform offers multiple interfaces:

- **Corese-library**: A Java library for RDF data processing.
- **Corese-Command**: A command-line interface for terminal interactions.
- **Corese-Gui**: A graphical interface for visual use.
- **Corese-Server**: A tool for creating and managing SPARQL endpoints.
- **Corese-Python**: A Python wrapper for RDF data manipulation.

Users can contribute to discussions, report issues, suggest features, and submit pull requests. The project is developed by Wimmics and is licensed under CeCILL-C. Support and discussions are available through a mailing list and a discussion forum.
