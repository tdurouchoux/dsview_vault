## Summary

Monolith is a deep learning framework for large-scale recommendation systems, built on TensorFlow. Key features include:

- **Collisionless embedding tables**: Ensures unique representations for different ID features.
- **Real-time training**: Captures the latest trends and helps users discover new interests rapidly.

The framework supports both batch and real-time training and serving. It is primarily developed in Python and C++, with some components in Starlark, Go, Shell, Dockerfile, and Makefile. The repository includes a README, license, and basic setup instructions for building from source. Tutorials and demos are available for distributed async training and using the MonolithModel API. The project is actively maintained with a community discussion group on Discord.
