## Summary

Latent Scope is a tool designed for exploring and visualizing datasets through latent spaces. It simplifies the process of embedding unstructured data into high-dimensional vectors, reducing dimensionality, clustering, labeling clusters with an LLM, and exploring the annotated data via an interactive visualization.

Key features include:
- **Workflow Simplification**: Provides a web interface for each step of the process.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Tightly coupled with the input data for intuitive exploration.
- **Local and API Models**: Supports both open-source models that run locally and proprietary API services.
- **Flat Files**: All data is stored in flat files for easy export and integration into other pipelines.
- **Metadata Tracking**: Records all choices and parameters for reproducibility.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Offers a suite of scripts for setting up and exploring datasets.

The tool is designed to be part of a larger research and exploration process, making it easy to get data in and useful data out. It is built with a React frontend and a Python server backend, and supports several popular open-source embedding models.

Examples of use cases include analyzing survey responses, clustering GitHub issues and PRs, and exploring US Federal laws. The repository includes detailed documentation and notebooks for getting started and using the Python interface.
