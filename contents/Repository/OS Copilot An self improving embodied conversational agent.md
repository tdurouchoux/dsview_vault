## Summary

OS-Copilot is an open-source library designed to create generalist agents that can interact with various elements of an operating system, including web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and third-party applications. It aims to automate daily tasks through a self-improving embodied conversational agent.

Key features and updates include:
- Integration with vision capabilities (as of 2024.9).
- A front-end interface for user interaction (as of 2024.6).
- Acceptance at the LLM Agents Workshop at ICLR 2024 (as of 2024.3).

The project provides a quick start guide for installation and usage, along with tutorials ranging from beginner to advanced levels. It also offers a user interface for enhanced control and a community for support and collaboration.

The project is provided as-is without warranty, and users are responsible for any risks associated with its use. The code is primarily written in Python, with some JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
