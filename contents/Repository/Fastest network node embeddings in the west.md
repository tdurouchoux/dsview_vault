## Summary

The nodevectors package is designed for fast and scalable network node embeddings, supporting various algorithms and graph types, including NetworkX graphs and scipy CSR Sparse Matrices. Key algorithms include Node2Vec, GGVec, ProNE, GraRep, and GLoVe, along with support for any Scikit-Learn API model that supports fit_transform with n_components. The package leverages CSRGraphs for efficient graph representations and Numba JIT procedures for speed. It is particularly effective for large graphs, with recommendations for optimal algorithm parameters. The package also supports preprocessing for visualization algorithms like UMAP or T-SNE. Installation is straightforward via pip, and the package includes utilities for saving and loading models.
