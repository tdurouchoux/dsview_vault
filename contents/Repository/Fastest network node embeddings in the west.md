## Summary

The nodevectors package is designed for fast and scalable network node embeddings, supporting various algorithms and graph types. Key features include:

- **Supported Algorithms**: Node2Vec, GGVec, ProNE, GraRep, GLoVe, and any Scikit-Learn API model with fit_transform and n_components.
- **Installation**: Easily installed via pip, with dependencies automatically handled.
- **Quick Example**: Demonstrates how to use Node2Vec for embedding a graph and saving/loading models.
- **Large Graph Handling**: Recommends using CSRGraphs for large graphs and provides tips for optimizing different algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Suggests preprocessing with nodevectors for algorithms like UMAP or T-SNE.
- **Performance**: Achieves speed through CSRGraphs and Numba JIT'ed procedures.
- **Related Projects**: Lists other relevant projects for graph neural networks and node embeddings.

The package is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of graph embedding tasks.
