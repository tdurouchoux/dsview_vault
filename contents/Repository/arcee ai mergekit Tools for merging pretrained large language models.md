## Summary

Mergekit is a toolkit for merging pre-trained language models, designed to work efficiently in resource-constrained environments. It supports various merging algorithms and can operate on CPU or with minimal GPU resources (as little as 8 GB VRAM). Key features include support for multiple model architectures (e.g., Llama, Mistral, GPT-NeoX), lazy loading of tensors for low memory usage, and various merge methods like linear interpolation, SLERP, task arithmetic, and more. The toolkit also offers advanced functionalities such as LoRA extraction, Mixture of Experts merging, evolutionary merge methods, and multi-stage merging. Mergekit provides a YAML-based configuration system for specifying merge operations and supports tokenizer configuration and chat template customization. It can be used via a command-line interface or integrated into cloud-based workflows. The project is open-source and welcomes contributions.
