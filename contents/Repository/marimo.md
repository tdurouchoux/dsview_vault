## Summary

Marimo is an open-source, reactive Python notebook environment designed to address common issues with traditional notebooks. It offers a range of features including:

- **Reactive Execution**: Automatically runs dependent cells when a cell is executed, ensuring consistency and preventing bugs.
- **Interactive Elements**: Supports UI elements like sliders, dropdowns, and dataframes that automatically trigger cell re-execution.
- **Git-Friendly**: Notebooks are stored as pure Python files, making them compatible with version control systems.
- **SQL Support**: Allows querying dataframes, databases, and other data sources using SQL, with results returned as Python dataframes.
- **AI Integration**: Provides AI-assisted code generation tailored for data work, with context awareness and customizable prompts.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures deterministic execution order and eliminates hidden state.
- **Shareability**: Notebooks can be deployed as interactive web apps, slides, or run in the browser via WebAssembly.
- **Testability**: Supports running pytest on notebooks.
- **Modern Editor**: Includes features like GitHub Copilot, AI assistants, and variable explorers.

Marimo is designed to be a comprehensive tool that replaces multiple existing tools like Jupyter, Streamlit, and Papermill, offering a streamlined and powerful environment for data science and interactive programming.
