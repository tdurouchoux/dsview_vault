## Summary

Marimo is an open-source, reactive Python notebook that automatically runs dependent cells when a cell is executed or a UI element is interacted with, ensuring consistency and preventing bugs. Key features include:

- **Reactive Programming**: Automatically runs dependent cells or marks them as stale.
- **Interactive Elements**: Supports sliders, tables, plots, and more without requiring callbacks.
- **Git-Friendly**: Stored as .py files, making it compatible with version control systems.
- **Data-Centric**: Supports SQL queries, dataframe operations, and interactive data exploration.
- **AI Integration**: Offers AI-assisted code generation tailored for data work.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures deterministic execution and built-in package management.
- **Executable**: Can be run as a Python script or deployed as a web app.
- **Shareable**: Can be deployed as an interactive web app or slides, and run in the browser via WASM.
- **Reusable**: Allows importing functions and classes across notebooks.
- **Testable**: Supports running pytest on notebooks.
- **Modern Editor**: Includes features like GitHub Copilot, AI assistants, and vim keybindings.

Marimo aims to solve common issues associated with traditional notebooks like Jupyter, emphasizing reproducibility, maintainability, composability, and shareability. It is designed to be a comprehensive tool that replaces multiple existing tools, offering a streamlined and efficient workflow for data scientists.
