## Summary

StellarGraph is a Python library for machine learning on graphs and networks, built on TensorFlow 2, Keras, Pandas, and NumPy. It supports various graph types, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and knowledge graphs, with or without node/edge attributes and edge weights. The library offers state-of-the-art algorithms for tasks like node/edge representation learning, classification, link prediction, and graph classification. Key algorithms include GraphSAGE, HinSAGE, GCN, GAT, and others. StellarGraph integrates smoothly with Pandas, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn, making it user-friendly and extensible. It can be installed via PyPI, Anaconda, or from GitHub source. The library is designed and supported by CSIRO's Data61 and is open-source under the Apache-2.0 license.
