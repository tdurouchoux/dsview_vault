## Summary

StellarGraph is a Python library for machine learning on graphs and networks, built on TensorFlow 2, Keras, Pandas, and NumPy. It supports various graph types and tasks such as node and edge representation learning, classification, link prediction, and graph classification. The library includes state-of-the-art algorithms like GraphSAGE, GAT, GCN, and more. It is user-friendly, modular, and extensible, with smooth interoperability with other libraries. Installation is straightforward via pip, Anaconda, or from the GitHub source. The library is designed and supported by CSIRO's Data61 and is open-source under the Apache-2.0 license.
