## Summary

Agent Skills are a simple, open format designed to enhance agents' capabilities by providing them with procedural knowledge and context-specific resources. They enable agents to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently by accessing reusable instructions and organizational knowledge. Key benefits include:

- **For Skill Authors**: Build capabilities once and deploy them across multiple agent products.
- **For Compatible Agents**: Support for skills allows end users to give agents new capabilities out of the box.
- **For Teams and Enterprises**: Capture organizational knowledge in portable, version-controlled packages.

Agent Skills can enable domain expertise, new capabilities, repeatable workflows, and interoperability across different agent products. The format is open to contributions from the broader ecosystem and is supported by leading AI development tools. The specification and integration guidelines are available for developers to add skills support to their agents or tools.
