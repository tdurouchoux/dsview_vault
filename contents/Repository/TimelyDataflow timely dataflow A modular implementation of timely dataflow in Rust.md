## Summary

Timely Dataflow is a Rust-based implementation of a low-latency cyclic dataflow computational model, inspired by the Naiad system. It aims to provide a modular, expressive, and high-performance framework for distributed data-parallel computations. Key features include:

1. **Expressive Power and Performance**: Timely Dataflow is designed to be more expressive and faster than traditional data processing frameworks, scaling from single-threaded to distributed execution across clusters.

2. **Core Components**:
   - **Timely Dataflow**: Provides primitive operators like map, filter, and concat, along with more exotic operators for tasks like entering and exiting loops.
   - **Differential Dataflow**: A higher-level language built on timely dataflow, featuring operators like group, join, and iterate, with fully incrementalized implementations.

3. **Execution Model**:
   - Supports both single-threaded and multi-threaded execution within a process.
   - Can scale to distributed execution across multiple processes using a hostfile to specify hostnames and ports.

4. **Ecosystem and Applications**:
   - Includes applications like a streaming worst-case optimal join implementation and a PageRank implementation.
   - Encourages community contributions to expand the set of higher-level abstractions and applications.

5. **Contribution Opportunities**:
   - Writing programs using timely dataflow to provide feedback on ergonomics and bug reports.
   - Contributing examples, documentation, and tests.
   - Addressing issues related to performance optimization, buffer management, and support for non-serializable types.
   - Exploring larger themes like rate-controlling output and coarse- vs fine-grained timestamps.

The project is open-source under the MIT license and welcomes contributions from the community to enhance its functionality and performance.
