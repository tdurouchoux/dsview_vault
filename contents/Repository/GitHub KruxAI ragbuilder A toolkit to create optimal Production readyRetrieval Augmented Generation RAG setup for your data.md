## Summary

RagBuilder is a toolkit designed to create production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setups. It automates the optimization of RAG parameters through hyperparameter tuning, evaluating configurations against a test dataset to identify the best setup. Key features include:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses Bayesian optimization to optimize RAG configurations.
- **Pre-defined RAG Templates**: Offers state-of-the-art templates like Graph retriever and Contextual chunker.
- **Evaluation Dataset Options**: Allows the generation of synthetic test datasets or the use of custom datasets.
- **Component Access**: Provides direct access to vectorstore, retriever, and generator components.
- **API Deployment**: Enables easy deployment as an API service.
- **Project Persistence**: Supports saving and loading optimized RAG pipelines.

**Installation**:
```bash
# Create a new venv
uv venv ragbuilder

# Activate the new venv
source ragbuilder/bin/activate

# Install
uv pip install ragbuilder
```

**Quick Start**:
```python
from ragbuilder import RAGBuilder

# Initialize and optimize with defaults
builder = RAGBuilder.from_source_with_defaults(input_source='https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/')
results = builder.optimize()

# Run a query through the complete pipeline
response = results.invoke("What is HNSW?")

# View optimization summary
print(results.summary())
```

**Configuration**:
- **Basic Configuration**: Uses default settings for most use cases.
- **Advanced Configuration**: Allows fine-grained control over data ingestion, retrieval, and generation options.

**Component Options**:
- **Document Loaders**: Includes options like unstructured, pymupdf, pypdf, and web loaders.
- **Chunking Strategies**: Offers strategies like RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, CharacterTextSplitter, and SemanticChunker.
- **Retrievers**: Provides options like vector_similarity, bm25, and graph-based retrieval.
- **Rerankers**: Includes rerankers like BAAI/bge-reranker-base and cohere.

**Environment Variables**:
- Requires OPENAI_API_KEY and optional keys for additional features like MISTRAL_API_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY.

**Advanced Topics**:
- **Custom Evaluation Metrics**: Allows the use of custom evaluation metrics.
- **Optimization Configuration**: Fine-tunes optimization parameters.
- **API Deployment**: Deploys RAGBuilder as an API service.
- **Project Management**: Saves and loads optimized RAG pipelines.

**Best Practices**:
- Start simple and add complexity only when needed.
- Ensure test data quality and use domain-specific evaluation metrics.
- Monitor memory usage and implement rate limiting for API endpoints.

**Contributing**:
- Contributions are welcome, with guidelines available in CONTRIBUTING.md.

**License**:
- The project is licensed under the MIT License.
