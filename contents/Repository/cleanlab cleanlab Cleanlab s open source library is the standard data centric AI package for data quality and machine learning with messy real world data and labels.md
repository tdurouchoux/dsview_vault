## Summary

Cleanlab is an open-source library designed for data-centric AI, focusing on data quality and machine learning with real-world, messy data and labels. It helps users clean data and detect issues in machine learning datasets, improving model performance without changing the modeling code.

Key features include:
- Automatic detection of data issues such as outliers, duplicates, and label errors.
- Support for various machine learning tasks like classification, regression, image segmentation, and object detection.
- Compatibility with any model (PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, etc.) and dataset type (text, image, tabular, audio).
- Tools for training robust models and inferring consensus labels for multi-annotator data.
- Active learning capabilities to suggest data for (re)labeling.
- State-of-the-art algorithms for label cleaning and noise-robust training.

The library is backed by peer-reviewed research and offers example notebooks, a blog, and community support. It is available under the AGPL-3.0 license, with commercial licensing options available.
