## Summary

mlpack is a fast, header-only C++ machine learning library with bindings to Python, Julia, R, Go, and the command-line. It is built on Armadillo, ensmallen, and cereal, aiming to provide fast and extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. The latest version is 4.7.0, released in January 2026. mlpack uses an open governance model and is fiscally sponsored by NumFOCUS. It is open-source software licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. The project encourages citations for its use and accepts donations to support its development.
