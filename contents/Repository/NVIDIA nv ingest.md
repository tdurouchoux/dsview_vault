## Summary

NeMo Retriever extraction is a scalable microservice for document content and metadata extraction, utilizing NVIDIA NIM microservices. It extracts text, tables, charts, and images for use in generative applications. The service supports various file types and offers multiple extraction methods to balance throughput and accuracy. It can optionally compute embeddings and store them in a vector database like Milvus. The pipeline has evolved, replacing deprecated components with yolox-graphic-elements NIM, enabling operation on a single GPU. The service is available under the Apache-2.0 license and requires adherence to the Developer Certificate of Origin for contributions. Security considerations emphasize the responsibility of end users to ensure secure deployment and maintenance.
