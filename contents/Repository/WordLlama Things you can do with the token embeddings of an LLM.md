## Summary

WordLlama is a lightweight NLP toolkit designed for tasks like fuzzy deduplication, similarity computation, ranking, clustering, and semantic text splitting. It operates with minimal dependencies and is optimized for CPU hardware.

Key features include:
- Fast embeddings with simple token lookup and average pooling.
- Similarity computation, ranking, fuzzy deduplication, clustering, filtering, and top-K retrieval.
- Semantic text splitting and support for binary embeddings with Hamming similarity.
- Matryoshka representations for flexible embedding dimension truncation.
- Low resource requirements, optimized for CPU inference.

WordLlama recycles components from large language models (LLMs) to create efficient and compact word representations. It starts by extracting the token embedding codebook from state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3 70B) and trains a small context-less model within a general-purpose embedding framework. This approach results in a lightweight model that improves on all MTEB benchmarks over traditional word models like GloVe 300d, while being substantially smaller in size (e.g., 16MB default model at 256 dimensions).

The toolkit includes various usage examples, such as embedding text, calculating similarity, ranking documents, fuzzy deduplication, clustering, filtering, top-K retrieval, and semantic text splitting. It also supports loading Model2Vec for static embeddings and provides an inference class for direct use with custom static embeddings arrays.

WordLlama is licensed under the MIT License and includes a citation for academic or project use. The project is actively maintained with a roadmap that includes additional example notebooks for DSPy evaluators and RAG pipelines. Community projects and contributions are also highlighted.
