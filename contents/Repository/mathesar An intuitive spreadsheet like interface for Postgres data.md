## Summary

Mathesar is an open-source, self-hosted web application designed to simplify interaction with PostgreSQL databases. It offers a spreadsheet-like interface, enabling users of all technical skill levels to view, edit, query, and collaborate on data without needing to write code. Key features include:

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Directly connects to existing PostgreSQL databases, utilizing native Postgres access control.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a user-friendly interface for data entry, filtering, sorting, and grouping, along with a query builder for constructing SQL queries without knowledge of SQL.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with other tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem and supports data import/export.
- **Custom Data Types**: Includes custom data types for emails and URLs, validated at the database level.
- **Schema Management**: Allows easy creation and updating of Postgres schemas and tables, including schema migrations.
- **Security and Control**: Being self-hosted, it ensures data never leaves your servers, and access control is based on Postgres roles and privileges.

Mathesar is currently in public beta, indicating it is stable and feature-rich enough for production use. It is maintained by the Mathesar Foundation, a nonprofit organization committed to keeping the project open source. The project encourages community contributions and provides extensive documentation and community support.
