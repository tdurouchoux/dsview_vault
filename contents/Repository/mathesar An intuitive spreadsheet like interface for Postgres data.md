## Summary

Mathesar is an open-source, self-hosted web application designed to simplify interaction with PostgreSQL databases. It offers a spreadsheet-like interface, enabling users of all technical skill levels to view, edit, query, and collaborate on data without needing to write code. Key features include:

- **Postgres Integration**: Directly connects to existing PostgreSQL databases or allows setting up new ones.
- **Access Control**: Utilizes native PostgreSQL roles and privileges for secure data access.
- **Quick Installation**: Can be installed using Docker in minutes and integrates with existing infrastructure.
- **Data Management**: Supports data entry, filtering, sorting, grouping, and schema migrations.
- **Query Builder**: Includes a Data Explorer for building queries without SQL knowledge.
- **Interoperability**: Works alongside other tools in the PostgreSQL ecosystem.
- **Custom Data Types**: Supports custom data types like emails and URLs, validated at the database level.

Mathesar is currently in public beta, indicating it is stable and feature-rich enough for production use. The project is maintained by the Mathesar Foundation, a nonprofit organization committed to keeping the tool open-source and accessible. The application is built using technologies like Svelte, TypeScript, Python, and PLpgSQL.
