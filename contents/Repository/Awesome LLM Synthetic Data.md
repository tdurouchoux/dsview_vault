## Summary

The repository "Awesome-LLM-Synthetic-Data" is a curated list of resources focused on synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs). It is organized into several sections:

1. **Surveys**: This section includes recent surveys and reviews on the topic of synthetic data generation, evaluation, and its applications in various domains.

2. **Methods**: This section is divided into two subsections:
   - **Techniques**: It covers various techniques and approaches for generating synthetic data using LLMs, including self-improvement, instruction generation, and data augmentation methods.
   - **Instruction Generation with High Quality/Complexity**: It focuses on methods for generating high-quality and complex instructions for LLMs.

3. **Application Areas**: This section highlights the application of synthetic data generation in various domains such as:
   - Mathematical Reasoning
   - Code Generation
   - Text-to-SQL
   - Alignment
   - Reward Modeling
   - Long Context
   - Weak-to-Strong
   - Agent and Tool Use
   - Vision and Language
   - Factuality

4. **Datasets**: This section lists datasets that have been generated using LLMs for various tasks and applications.

5. **Tools**: This section includes tools and frameworks that facilitate synthetic data generation and management.

6. **Blogs**: This section provides links to blogs and articles that discuss various aspects of synthetic data generation using LLMs.

The repository aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the field of synthetic data generation using LLMs.
