## Summary

Context7 MCP Server is a tool designed to provide up-to-date code documentation for LLMs (Large Language Models) and AI code editors. It addresses the issues of outdated or hallucinated API information by fetching current, version-specific documentation and code examples directly from the source.

Key features include:
- Integration with various AI code editors and clients like Cursor, Claude Code, VSCode, and others.
- Installation via Smithery or direct configuration in the respective editor's settings.
- Support for both remote and local server connections.
- Tools like `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` to fetch relevant documentation.
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues such as module not found errors, ESM resolution issues, and TLS/certificate problems.

The repository hosts the source code for the Context7 MCP server, while the supporting components like the API backend, parsing engine, and crawling engine remain private. The project is community-contributed, and users are encouraged to report any suspicious or inappropriate content.
