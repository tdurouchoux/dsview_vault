## Summary

Validoopsie is a lightweight and user-friendly data validation library for Python, designed to simplify the data validation process. It allows users to declare classes and chain validations together, similar to popular DataFrame libraries. The library supports the "Bring Your Own DataFrame" (BYOD) concept, enabling the use of any DataFrame supported by Narwhals.

Key features include:
- Simple and intuitive syntax with method-specific design for ease of use.
- Inspired by Great Expectations, focusing on straightforward and efficient data validation.
- Customizable impact levels to control error raising.
- Comprehensive documentation and development guidelines.

Example usage involves importing the library, creating a DataFrame, and chaining validation methods. The library provides detailed output on validation results, including status, messages, and failing items. Development tasks are simplified with a Makefile for setting up dependencies, running linters, and executing tests. The library is licensed under MIT.
