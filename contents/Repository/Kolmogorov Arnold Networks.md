## Summary

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are presented as an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. KANs feature activation functions on edges rather than nodes, potentially offering better accuracy and interpretability. The repository provides installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation for implementing KANs. Key points include the importance of starting with simple setups, tuning hyperparameters, and considering both accuracy and interpretability. The author emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of KANs and their potential applications, particularly in scientific contexts. The repository is maintained primarily for scientific purposes, with ongoing developments aimed at improving efficiency and usability.
