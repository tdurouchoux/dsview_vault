## Summary

FastMCP is a Python framework for building servers and clients for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized way to provide context and tools to large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the process of creating MCP servers and clients with minimal boilerplate, offering a high-level, Pythonic interface.

Key features include:
- **Tools**: Define functions that LLMs can execute, with automatic schema generation from type hints and docstrings.
- **Resources & Templates**: Expose read-only data sources with dynamic templates for specific data subsets.
- **Prompts**: Create reusable message templates to guide LLM interactions.
- **Context**: Access session capabilities within tools, resources, or prompts for logging, LLM sampling, HTTP requests, and more.
- **Clients**: Interact with MCP servers programmatically, supporting various transports and advanced patterns.
- **Advanced Features**: Proxy servers, server composition, OpenAPI & FastAPI generation, and authentication & security.

FastMCP aims to be fast, simple, Pythonic, and complete, providing a comprehensive platform for all MCP use cases, from development to production. The framework is actively maintained and includes a complete toolkit for working with the MCP ecosystem, including deployment, authentication, clients, server proxying, and more.
