## Summary

FastMCP is a Python framework for building servers and clients for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes context and tools for LLMs. FastMCP 2.0 offers a comprehensive toolkit for MCP, including deployment, authentication, clients, server proxying, and more. It is designed to be fast, simple, and Pythonic, reducing boilerplate and simplifying development.

Key features include:
- **Tools**: Define functions for LLMs to perform actions.
- **Resources & Templates**: Expose read-only data sources.
- **Prompts**: Create reusable message templates for LLM interactions.
- **Context**: Access session capabilities within tools, resources, or prompts.
- **Clients**: Interact with MCP servers programmatically.
- **Advanced Features**: Proxy servers, server composition, OpenAPI & FastAPI generation, and authentication.

FastMCP supports multiple transport protocols (STDIO, HTTP, SSE) and provides detailed documentation and testing tools. Contributions to the project are welcome, with guidelines for unit tests, static checks, and pull requests.
