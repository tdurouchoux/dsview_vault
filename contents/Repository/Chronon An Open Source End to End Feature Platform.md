## Summary

Chronon is an open-source, end-to-end feature platform for ML teams, enabling easy creation, deployment, management, and monitoring of data pipelines for machine learning. Key features include:

- Data consumption from various sources (event streams, DB tables, etc.)
- Results production in both online (low-latency endpoints) and offline (Hive tables) contexts
- Real-time or batch accuracy (temporal or snapshot)
- Backfilling training sets from raw data
- Powerful Python API with SQL-like primitives
- Automated feature monitoring

Example: A simple Chronon GroupBy aggregates user purchase metrics in various windows, creating offline datasets, feature serving endpoints, and data quality monitoring pipelines. The platform is maintained by Airbnb and Stripe, with contributions welcome.
