## Summary

The repository bytedance/coconut_cvpr2024 presents COCONut, a large-scale, human-verified dataset for segmentation tasks. Key points include:

- **Dataset Splits**: COCONut is available in multiple splits (S, B, L, XL) with varying sizes, ranging from 118K to 488K images and 1.54M to 6.43M masks.
- **Accessibility**: The dataset is accessible via Kaggle and Hugging Face, with tutorials provided for downloading and preparing the data.
- **Tutorials**: The repository includes tutorials on various segmentation tasks such as panoptic, instance, semantic, open-vocabulary segmentation, and object detection.
- **Usage**: The dataset is intended for research purposes and follows the same license as the COCO dataset, prohibiting commercial use.
- **Acknowledgements**: COCONut builds upon several existing datasets and tools, including SAMA-COCO, COCO, Objects365, and detectron2.

The repository also includes FAQs and visualization examples to aid users in understanding and utilizing the dataset effectively.
