## Summary

The COCONut dataset, presented at CVPR 2024 by ByteDance, is a large-scale, human-verified dataset designed for segmentation tasks. It is available on platforms like Kaggle and Hugging Face. The dataset is structured into several splits, including COCONut-S, COCONut-B, COCONut-L, COCONut-XL, and relabeled-COCO-val, each with varying numbers of images and masks. The dataset is intended for research purposes and follows the same license as the COCO dataset, prohibiting commercial use. Tutorials and FAQs are provided to assist users in utilizing the dataset effectively. The dataset is available for download through Kaggle and Hugging Face, with detailed instructions provided for each method. The dataset is acknowledged to build upon several existing datasets and tools, including SAMA-COCO, COCO, Objects365, kMax-DeepLab, FC-CLIP, and detectron2.
