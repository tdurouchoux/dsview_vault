## Summary

Metaflow is an open-source framework designed for real-life machine learning, AI, and data science projects. It simplifies the development, management, and deployment of these projects with several key features:

- **Modeling**: Supports any Python libraries for models and business logic, managing dependencies both locally and in the cloud.
- **Deployment**: Allows deployment of workflows to production with a single command and integrates with other systems through events.
- **Versioning**: Automatically tracks and stores variables within the flow for easy experiment tracking and debugging.
- **Orchestration**: Enables the creation of robust workflows in plain Python, which can be developed and debugged locally before deploying to production without changes.
- **Compute**: Leverages cloud computing to execute functions at scale, utilizing GPUs, multiple cores, and large amounts of memory as needed.
- **Data**: Accesses data from data warehouses and versions all data across steps.

Metaflow was originally developed at Netflix and is now used by hundreds of companies across various industries. It supports multiple cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes. Recent updates include support for recursive and conditional steps, custom decorators, and improved dependency management with uv. The framework aims to make it easier for data scientists and ML engineers to develop, scale, and deploy their projects efficiently.
