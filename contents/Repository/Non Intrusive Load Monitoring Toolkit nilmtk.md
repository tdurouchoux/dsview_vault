## Summary

The Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Toolkit (NILMTK) is an open-source Python toolkit designed to facilitate the evaluation of Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) algorithms. NILM aims to estimate the energy consumption of individual appliances using only whole-house power meter readings.

Key features of NILMTK include:
- Parsers for various datasets (8 and counting)
- Preprocessing algorithms
- Statistics for describing datasets
- Reference benchmark disaggregation algorithms
- Common accuracy metrics

NILMTK is designed to enable reproducible comparisons of energy disaggregation algorithms. It supports installation via uv and Docker for consistent environments. The toolkit has evolved significantly since its initial release, with the latest version being v0.4.2.

For academic use, users are encouraged to cite relevant NILMTK papers. The toolkit is maintained by a community of contributors and is licensed under Apache-2.0.
