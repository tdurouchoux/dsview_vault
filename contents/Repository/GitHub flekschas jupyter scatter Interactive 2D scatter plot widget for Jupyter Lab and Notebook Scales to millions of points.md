## Summary

Jupyter Scatter is an interactive 2D scatter plot widget designed for Jupyter Notebook, Lab, and Google Colab, capable of handling millions of data points. It offers features like interactive panning, zooming, and selecting data points, scalable rendering using WebGL, and synchronized views across multiple scatter plot instances. The tool integrates well with Pandas DataFrames and provides a user-friendly API. It is built using regl-scatterplot for WebGL rendering, traitlets for communication between the JS and iPython kernels, and anywidget for composing the widget. Jupyter Scatter can be installed via pip, with additional features available through an extended installation. The documentation and examples are available at jupyter-scatter.dev.
