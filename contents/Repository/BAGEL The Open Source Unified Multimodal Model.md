## Summary

BAGEL is an open-source, unified multimodal model designed to handle various tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and text-to-image generation. It leverages a transformer-based architecture to process and integrate information from different modalities (text, images). Key features include its ability to perform multiple tasks without task-specific fine-tuning, making it versatile for various applications. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to ensure robustness and generalizability. BAGEL's architecture consists of encoder and decoder components, with cross-modal attention mechanisms to facilitate interaction between modalities. The model is evaluated on standard benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance across different tasks. The open-source nature of BAGEL encourages community contributions and further research in multimodal learning.
