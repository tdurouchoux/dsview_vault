## Summary

LitServe is a deployment tool for AI models and systems, emphasizing simplicity and flexibility. It allows users to deploy various AI components such as agents, models, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and pipelines without requiring MLOps or YAML configuration. Key features include support for any PyTorch model, multi-GPU autoscaling, batching, streaming, and custom logic. It is designed to be faster than FastAPI and offers options for self-hosting or one-click deployment to Lightning AI's cloud platform. LitServe supports a wide range of AI tasks, including vision, audio, text, and more, and provides full control over the deployment process. It is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license and has a community-driven development model.
