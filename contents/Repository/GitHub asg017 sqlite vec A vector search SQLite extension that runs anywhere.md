## Summary

sqlite-vec is a lightweight, vector search SQLite extension designed for versatility and performance. Key features include:

- **Vector Storage and Querying**: Supports float, int8, and binary vectors in vec0 virtual tables.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Written in pure C, runs anywhere SQLite runs (Linux, MacOS, Windows, WASM, Raspberry Pis, etc.).
- **Metadata and Auxiliary Columns**: Allows storage of non-vector data alongside vectors.
- **Language Bindings**: Available for Python, Node.js, Ruby, Go, Rust, Datasette, rqlite, and sqlite-utils.
- **Sample Usage**: Demonstrates creating a virtual table, inserting vectors, and performing KNN-style queries.
- **Sponsorship**: Supported by Mozilla Builders, Fly.io, Turso, SQLite Cloud, and Shinkai.

The extension is pre-v1, so breaking changes are expected. It is part of the sqlite-ecosystem and is designed to be a successor to sqlite-vss.
