## Summary

The repository contains Stability AI's ongoing development of the StableLM series of language models, with continuous updates and new checkpoints. It includes several models, such as StableLM-3B-4E1T, StableLM-Alpha v2, StableLM-Alpha, and StableVicuna. The models are based on a decoder-only transformer architecture similar to LLaMA, with modifications like Rotary Position Embeddings and LayerNorm. The training data is a mixture of open-source large-scale datasets, and the models are evaluated using various benchmarks. The repository also includes code snippets for quickstart and examples of the model's capabilities in chit-chat, formal writing, creative writing, humor, and coding. The models are licensed under CC BY-SA-4.0 or CC BY-NC-SA-4.0, and the code is under the Apache License 2.0. The repository encourages community involvement and feedback.
