## Summary

The repository contains Stability AI's ongoing development of the StableLM series of language models, with continuous updates and new checkpoints. Key models include StableLM-3B-4E1T, StableLM-Alpha v2, StableLM-Alpha, and StableVicuna. StableLM-3B-4E1T is a 3B parameter model pre-trained on 1 trillion tokens for 4 epochs, achieving state-of-the-art performance at the 3B parameter scale. StableLM-Alpha v2 models improve on initial Alpha models with architectural enhancements and higher-quality data sources. StableLM-Alpha models are trained on a dataset 3x the size of The Pile. StableVicuna is an RLHF fine-tune of Vicuna-13B, developed by StabilityAI's CarperAI team. The repository includes technical reports, training details, evaluation results, and code snippets for inference. Potential issues include varying response quality and offensive language, expected to improve with scale and better data. The base model checkpoints are licensed under CC BY-SA-4.0, and fine-tuned checkpoints under CC BY-NC-SA-4.0.
