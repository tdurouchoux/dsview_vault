## Summary

The repository contains code examples for the book "Hands-On Large Language Models" by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst. The book is visually educational with almost 300 custom-made figures, covering practical tools and concepts for using Large Language Models (LLMs). It is available on various platforms including Amazon, O'Reilly, and Kindle.

The book is structured into 12 chapters, each with corresponding notebooks:

1. Introduction to Language Models
2. Tokens and Embeddings
3. Looking Inside Transformer LLMs
4. Text Classification
5. Text Clustering and Topic Modeling
6. Prompt Engineering
7. Advanced Text Generation Techniques and Tools
8. Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
9. Multimodal Large Language Models
10. Creating Text Embedding Models
11. Fine-tuning Representation Models for Classification
12. Fine-tuning Generation Models

The repository also includes bonus content such as visual guides to Mamba, Quantization, Stable Diffusion, Mixture of Experts, and Reasoning LLMs. The code examples are designed to be run through Google Colab for ease of setup, although other cloud providers should also work. The book has received positive reviews from notable figures in the field of AI and machine learning.
