## Summary

This GitHub repository contains the official code for the O'Reilly book "Hands-On Large Language Models" by Jay Alammar and Maarten Grootendorst. The book, dubbed "The Illustrated LLM Book," includes almost 300 custom-made figures to explain practical tools and concepts for using Large Language Models (LLMs).

The repository is structured into chapters, each corresponding to a notebook with practical examples. Key chapters include:

1. **Introduction to Language Models**: Basics of LLMs.
2. **Tokens and Embeddings**: Understanding tokens and embeddings.
3. **Looking Inside Transformer LLMs**: Insights into transformer architecture.
4. **Text Classification**: Techniques for text classification.
5. **Text Clustering and Topic Modeling**: Methods for clustering and topic modeling.
6. **Prompt Engineering**: Strategies for effective prompt engineering.
7. **Advanced Text Generation Techniques and Tools**: Advanced methods for text generation.
8. **Semantic Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Techniques for semantic search and RAG.
9. **Multimodal Large Language Models**: Working with multimodal LLMs.
10. **Creating Text Embedding Models**: Building text embedding models.
11. **Fine-tuning Representation Models for Classification**: Fine-tuning models for classification.
12. **Fine-tuning Generation Models**: Fine-tuning models for text generation.

The repository also includes bonus content such as visual guides to Mamba, quantization, and other advanced topics. The code is designed to run on Google Colab for ease of use, with additional setup guides for local installations. The book has received positive reviews from industry experts and is available on multiple platforms.
