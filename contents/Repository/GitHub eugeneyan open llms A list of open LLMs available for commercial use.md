## Summary

The content is a GitHub repository named "open-llms" curated by eugeneyan, which lists open large language models (LLMs) available for commercial use. The repository includes a comprehensive list of LLMs with details such as release dates, checkpoints, associated papers or blogs, the number of parameters, context lengths, licenses, and links to try the models. The models are categorized into general-purpose LLMs and those specifically for code. Additionally, the repository provides information on open LLM datasets for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and alignment-tuning, along with various evals and leaderboards for open LLMs. The licenses explained include Apache 2.0, MIT, CC BY-SA-4.0, OpenRAIL-M v1, and BSD-3-Clause, with a disclaimer noting that the information does not constitute legal advice. The repository aims to improve by completing entries for context length, adding the number of tokens trained, and including links to training code and eval benchmarks.
