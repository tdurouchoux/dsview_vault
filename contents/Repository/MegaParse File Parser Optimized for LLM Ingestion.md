## Summary

MegaParse is an open-source file parser designed for large language model (LLM) ingestion, focusing on no information loss during parsing. It supports various file types including PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Excel, CSV, and text files. Key features include versatility, speed, efficiency, and wide file compatibility. It handles tables, tables of contents, headers, footers, and images within documents.

Installation requires Python 3.11 or higher and additional tools like poppler and tesseract for image and PDF processing. MegaParse can be used directly, with its vision capabilities for multimodal models, or as an API. Benchmarks show it outperforms other parsers in similarity ratio.

Current developments include improving table checking, adding modular post-processing, and enabling structured output. The project is actively maintained with frequent releases and contributions.
