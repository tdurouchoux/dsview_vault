## Summary

FastAPI Guard is an enterprise-grade security middleware designed for FastAPI applications. It provides a robust set of features to enhance security, including:

- **Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods such as OAuth2, JWT, and API keys.
- **Authorization**: Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Helps prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make.
- **CORS Management**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to control which domains can access your API.
- **Security Headers**: Adds security headers to responses to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks and logs user activities for compliance and monitoring.

The middleware is designed to be easily integrated into existing FastAPI applications, providing a comprehensive security layer with minimal configuration. It is particularly useful for enterprise applications where security and compliance are critical.
