## Summary

TorchGeo is a PyTorch domain library designed for geospatial data, offering datasets, samplers, transforms, and pre-trained models. It aims to simplify machine learning for geospatial data and remote sensing applications.

Key features include:

- **Geospatial Datasets and Samplers**: TorchGeo provides tools to handle geospatial datasets with varying spectral bands, resolutions, and coordinate reference systems (CRS). It supports operations like combining datasets from multiple sources and sampling image patches.

- **Benchmark Datasets**: The library includes benchmark datasets for various tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. These datasets can be easily integrated into existing PyTorch workflows.

- **Pre-trained Weights**: TorchGeo supports models pre-trained on multispectral sensors, which is beneficial for transfer learning tasks in remote sensing. It adopts torchvision's multi-weight API for easy integration.

- **Reproducibility with Lightning**: TorchGeo offers Lightning datamodules and trainers for tasks like classification, regression, and semantic segmentation. It supports command-line interface training using LightningCLI, making it easy to configure and run experiments.

- **Community and Contributions**: The project welcomes contributions and has adopted the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct. Documentation and tutorials are available on ReadTheDocs.

TorchGeo is designed to be user-friendly for both machine learning experts and remote sensing experts, providing a comprehensive toolkit for working with geospatial data.
