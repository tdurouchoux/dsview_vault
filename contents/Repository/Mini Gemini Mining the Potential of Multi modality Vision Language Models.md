## Summary

Mini-Gemini is a framework designed to enhance multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLMs). It addresses the performance gap between current VLMs and advanced models like GPT-4 and Gemini by focusing on three key aspects: high-resolution visual tokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation.

Key technical points:
1. **Dual Vision Encoders**: Uses two visual encoders to provide both low-resolution and high-resolution visual embeddings.
2. **Patch Info Mining**: Conducts patch-level mining between high-resolution regions and low-resolution visual queries to enhance visual understanding.
3. **High-Quality Dataset**: Constructs a dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and reasoning-based generation.
4. **LLM Integration**: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to marry text with images for both comprehension and generation simultaneously.

Mini-Gemini supports a range of LLMs from 2B to 34B and has demonstrated leading performance in several zero-shot benchmarks, even surpassing some developed private models. The framework is conceptually simple yet effective in enhancing the capabilities of VLMs.
