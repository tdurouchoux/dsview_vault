## Summary

Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed for building production-grade applications and workflows with Generative AI. It offers several key features:

- **Model-agnostic**: Supports a wide range of models and providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon Bedrock, Hugging Face, and more.
- **Seamless Observability**: Integrates with Pydantic Logfire for real-time debugging, performance monitoring, and cost tracking.
- **Fully Type-safe**: Designed to provide IDE and AI coding agent context for auto-completion and type checking.
- **Powerful Evals**: Enables systematic testing and evaluation of agentic systems.
- **MCP, A2A, and AG-UI**: Integrates standards for tool access, interoperability with other agents, and interactive applications.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Tool Approval**: Allows flagging tool calls for approval based on various criteria.
- **Durable Execution**: Supports long-running, asynchronous, and human-in-the-loop workflows with reliability.
- **Streamed Outputs**: Provides continuous streaming of structured output with immediate validation.
- **Graph Support**: Offers a powerful way to define graphs using type hints for complex applications.

The documentation includes examples such as a "Hello World" example and a bank support agent example, demonstrating the framework's capabilities. Additionally, Pydantic AI integrates with Pydantic Logfire for monitoring and performance tracking, and the documentation is available in the llms.txt format for easy access by LLMs and AI coding assistants.
