## Summary

Pretzel is a modern, open-source fork of Jupyter Notebook designed to enhance data science workflows with AI capabilities. Key features include AI code generation and editing, inline tab completion, sidebar chat for error fixing, and seamless integration with existing Jupyter configurations. Installation is straightforward via pip or Docker, with support for various AI models like GPT-4 and Mistral's Codestral. The tool is licensed under AGPL-3.0, ensuring open-source contributions while preventing proprietary forks. Pretzel aims to become the de-facto data tool by offering features like real-time collaboration, SQL support, and visual analysis, with a roadmap driven by community feedback. The project is maintained by a small team, with plans to monetize through a hosted enterprise version.
