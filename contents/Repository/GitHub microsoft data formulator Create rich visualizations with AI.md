## Summary

Data Formulator is an AI-powered tool from Microsoft Research designed to expedite data visualization by leveraging large language models. It combines user interface interactions with natural language inputs, making it easier for users to create rich visualizations. Key features include:

1. **Iterative Visualization Creation**: Users can start with an analysis goal or let the AI recommend exploration ideas. The tool supports working with large datasets, anchoring intermediate datasets, and handling multiple datasets simultaneously.

2. **Data Transformation**: Users can specify visual encodings and let the AI transform the data to create visualizations. Follow-up prompts allow for further refinement and exploration.

3. **Model Support**: The tool supports various models like OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, and Anthropic, with recommendations for models with strong code generation capabilities.

4. **Data Loading**: It includes external data loaders for various sources such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Azure Data Explorer, Azure Blob, Amazon S3, and more.

5. **Development and Contribution**: Data Formulator can be installed via Python PIP, run in Codespaces, or built locally. The project welcomes contributions and follows Microsoft's Open Source Code of Conduct.

6. **Research Backing**: The tool is supported by research papers published in arXiv and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

Overall, Data Formulator aims to simplify the data visualization process by integrating AI-driven data transformation with user-friendly interface interactions.
