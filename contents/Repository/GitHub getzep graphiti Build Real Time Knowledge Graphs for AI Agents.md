## Summary

Graphiti is a framework for building and querying temporally-aware knowledge graphs tailored for AI agents in dynamic environments. It integrates user interactions, structured and unstructured data, and external information into a coherent, queryable graph, supporting incremental updates, efficient retrieval, and precise historical queries without full graph recomputation.

Key features include real-time incremental updates, a bi-temporal data model, hybrid retrieval methods (semantic, keyword, graph-based), custom entity definitions, and scalability. Graphiti is designed to handle dynamic and frequently updated datasets, making it suitable for real-time interaction and precise historical queries.

The framework supports various database backends like Neo4j, FalkorDB, Kuzu, and Amazon Neptune, and integrates with LLM providers such as OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, and local LLMs via Ollama. It also includes an MCP server for AI assistant interaction and a REST service for API interactions.

Graphiti is part of Zep's Context Engineering Platform, offering agent memory, Graph RAG for dynamic data, and context retrieval and assembly. The project is open-source and actively developed, with contributions encouraged and detailed guidelines provided. Telemetry is collected anonymously to improve the framework, but can be disabled if preferred.
