## Summary

Quivr is an opinionated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework designed to simplify the integration of Generative AI into applications. It supports various LLMs (e.g., GPT4, Groq, Llama) and vector stores (e.g., PGVector, Faiss), and works with any file type. Key features include easy customization, integration with Megaparse for file ingestion, and a focus on allowing developers to concentrate on their product rather than the RAG implementation.

**Key Technical Points:**
- **Opiniated RAG:** Pre-configured for efficiency and ease of use.
- **LLM and Vector Store Compatibility:** Works with multiple LLMs and vector stores.
- **File Support:** Handles various file types and allows custom parsers.
- **Customization:** Supports adding internet search, tools, and other enhancements.
- **Integration with Megaparse:** Facilitates file ingestion and RAG usage.

**Getting Started:**
- **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or newer.
- **Installation:** `pip install quivr-core`.
- **Basic Usage:** Create a RAG with a few lines of code, configure workflows using YAML, and interact with the brain via a chat interface.

**Configuration:**
- **Workflow Configuration:** Define nodes and edges for the RAG workflow.
- **LLM and Reranker Configuration:** Set parameters like max tokens, temperature, and reranker settings.

**Contribution and Community:**
- **Contributors:** Open to pull requests and new ideas.
- **Partners:** Acknowledges support from partners.

**License:** Apache 2.0.
