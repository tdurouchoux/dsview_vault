## Summary

Quivr is an opinionated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) framework designed to simplify the integration of Generative AI into applications. It allows users to focus on their product rather than the underlying RAG technology. Key features include:

- **Compatibility**: Works with any LLM (e.g., GPT4, Groq, Llama) and any vector store (e.g., PGVector, Faiss).
- **File Support**: Supports various file types (PDF, TXT, Markdown) and allows custom parsers.
- **Customization**: Users can customize their RAG, add internet search, and integrate tools.
- **Integration with Megaparse**: Facilitates file ingestion and RAG usage.

**Getting Started**:
1. Install the package: `pip install quivr-core`.
2. Create a basic RAG workflow with a few lines of code.
3. Configure the RAG using a YAML file.
4. Launch a chat interface to interact with the RAG.

**Advanced Features**:
- Users can extend functionality by adding internet search, tools, and more.
- The project is open-source and actively maintained, with contributions welcome.

**Technical Details**:
- Requires Python 3.10 or newer.
- Supports APIs from Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, and local models using Ollama.
- Configuration includes settings for history, reranker, and LLM parameters.

Quivr aims to streamline the process of integrating AI into applications, making it easier for developers to focus on their product rather than the complexities of RAG implementation.
