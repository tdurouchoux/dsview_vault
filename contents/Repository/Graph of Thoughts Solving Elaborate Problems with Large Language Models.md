## Summary

The content is about the official implementation of "Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models." This framework, designed to solve complex problems, models them as a Graph of Operations (GoO) and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) as the engine. Key points include:

- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: The framework allows for solving problems using the GoT approach and implementing GoOs resembling previous approaches like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thought (ToT).
- **Setup and Installation**: Requires Python 3.8 or newer. Installation can be done via PyPI or from source for developers.
- **Configuration**: Users need access to an LLM and must follow instructions to configure it.
- **Quick Start**: Provides code snippets for using the framework with both CoT-like and GoT approaches, including how to run and compare the results.
- **Documentation**: Includes a paper for a high-level overview and detailed documentation for individual modules, especially the Controller and Operations modules.
- **Examples**: Contains several examples of problems solved using the framework, with instructions on how to run and understand them.
- **Paper Results**: Instructions for running experiments from the paper and inspecting results.
- **Citations**: Encourages citing the work if used, with a provided citation format.

The repository is well-documented and includes contributions from multiple authors, with a focus on Python.
