## Summary

The "Graph of Thoughts" (GoT) framework is designed to solve complex problems by modeling them as a Graph of Operations (GoO), executed using a Large Language Model (LLM) as the engine. This approach is flexible and extensible, allowing for the implementation of various problem-solving strategies, including Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT).

Key points include:

- **Setup and Installation**: Requires Python 3.8 or newer. Installation can be done via PyPI or from source for developers.
- **LLM Configuration**: Users need to configure their preferred LLM by following the provided instructions.
- **Quick Start**: The framework can be used to solve problems like sorting a list of numbers using either a CoT-like approach or the more sophisticated GoT approach. Example code snippets are provided for both methods.
- **Documentation and Examples**: The repository includes detailed documentation and examples to help users understand and extend the framework. The examples directory contains various problems solved using the framework, with instructions for running and experimenting with them.
- **Paper Results**: Users can run experiments from the paper or inspect and replot the results using the provided data.
- **Citations**: The repository encourages users to cite the associated paper if they find the framework valuable.

The framework is well-documented, with a focus on making it easy for users to understand and extend its functionality.
