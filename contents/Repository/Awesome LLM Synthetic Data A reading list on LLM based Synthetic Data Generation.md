## Summary

The repository "Awesome-LLM-Synthetic-Data" is a curated list of resources focused on synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs). It is organized into several sections:

1. **Surveys**: This section includes recent surveys and reviews on synthetic data generation, evaluation, and applications in LLMs. It covers topics like data contamination, vision-language models, and best practices.

2. **Methods**: This section is divided into techniques and instruction generation with high quality/complexity. It lists various methods and papers that discuss how to generate synthetic data, improve instruction following, and enhance the quality and complexity of the generated data.

3. **Application Areas**: This section covers various applications of synthetic data in LLMs, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, text-to-SQL, alignment, reward modeling, long context understanding, weak-to-strong transfer, agent and tool use, vision and language, and factuality.

4. **Datasets**: This section lists datasets that are used or generated for training and evaluating LLMs. It includes datasets for specific tasks like text-to-SQL and personal attribute inference.

5. **Tools**: This section lists tools and frameworks that facilitate synthetic data generation and management, such as DataDreamer and AgentInstruct.

6. **Blogs**: This section includes blog posts and articles that discuss trends, techniques, and evaluations related to synthetic data generation in LLMs.

The repository aims to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the field of synthetic data generation using LLMs.
