## Summary

WAT is a Python inspection tool designed to help explore and understand unknown objects at runtime. It provides detailed information about an object's type, formatted value, variables, methods, parent types, signature, documentation, and source code. The tool can be used in a Python interpreter or integrated into a script. It supports various modifiers to customize the output, such as hiding attributes, showing dunder attributes, displaying source code, and more. WAT can be installed via pip or loaded directly into a Python session using an "Insta-Load" snippet. It is particularly useful for debugging, understanding complex data structures, and learning Python internals. The tool is inspired by Rich Inspect and is released under the MIT license.
