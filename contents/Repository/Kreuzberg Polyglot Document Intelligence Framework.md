## Summary

Kreuzberg is a polyglot document intelligence framework with a Rust core, designed for extracting text, metadata, and structured information from a wide range of file formats (56+). It supports various programming languages including Rust, Python, Ruby, Go, TypeScript/Node.js, Java, C#, PHP, and Elixir. Key features include:

- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin system for custom OCR backends, validators, post-processors, and document extractors.
- **High Performance**: Rust core with native PDFium, SIMD optimizations, and full parallelism.
- **OCR Support**: Multiple OCR backends (Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR) with table detection and reconstruction.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Available as a library, CLI tool, REST API server, or MCP server.
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming parsers for multi-GB files.
- **Embeddings Support**: Optional embeddings functionality using ONNX Runtime 1.22.x.

The framework supports a variety of file formats across categories like Office documents, images, web & data, email & archives, and academic & scientific formats. It also includes features like batch processing, password-protected PDF handling, language detection, and comprehensive metadata extraction.

Kreuzberg is open-source under the MIT License, allowing free use in both commercial and closed-source products. The project is actively maintained with contributions welcome.
