## Summary

Rill is a tool for transforming datasets into powerful, opinionated dashboards using SQL, following a BI-as-code approach. It is designed for rapid, self-service dashboards built directly on raw data lakes, eliminating traditional BI complexity. Key features include:

- **Lightning Fast Performance**: Powered by SvelteKit and DuckDB for quick performance.
- **Universal Data Support**: Works with local and remote datasets (Parquet, CSV, S3, GCS, HTTPS, local).
- **Automatic Profiling**: Builds intuition about datasets through automatic profiling.
- **Real-time Response**: Responds to each keystroke by re-profiling the resulting dataset.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Thoughtful, opinionated defaults for quick insights.
- **Dashboards as Code**: Version control, Git sharing, and easy project rehydration.

**Core Concepts**:
- **BI-As-Code**: Uses SQL-based definitions, YAML configuration, Git integration, and CLI tools.
- **Metrics Layer**: Provides a unified way to define, compute, and serve business metrics.
- **AI Agents**: Designed to provide AI systems with structured, real-time data for quick and accurate responses.

**Production Examples**:
- Programmatic Ads/OpenRTB
- Cost Monitoring
- GitHub Analytics
- App Engagement
- Kitchen-sink example
