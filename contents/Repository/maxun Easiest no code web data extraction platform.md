## Summary

Maxun is an open-source, no-code web data extraction platform that allows users to create custom robots to scrape data from websites. The platform offers both a hosted version and options for local installation via Docker or manual setup. Key features include:

- **Robot Actions**: Capture lists, text, or screenshots from websites.
- **BYOP (Bring Your Own Proxy)**: Connect external proxies to bypass anti-bot protection.
- **Integrations**: Turn websites into APIs or spreadsheets, handle pagination and scrolling, and schedule robot runs.
- **Self-Hosting**: Community guides are available for self-hosting the platform.

The project is licensed under AGPLv3 and is actively developed, with contributions welcome. It supports various integrations and is designed to adapt to website layout changes, making it a versatile tool for web data extraction.
