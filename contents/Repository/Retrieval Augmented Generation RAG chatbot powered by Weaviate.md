## Summary

Verba is an open-source Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot powered by Weaviate. It offers a user-friendly interface for querying and interacting with data, either locally or via cloud, using state-of-the-art RAG techniques. Key features include support for various models (Ollama, HuggingFace, Cohere, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Novita AI, Upstage), embedding models, data types, chunking techniques, and LLM providers. It also supports hybrid search, autocomplete suggestions, filtering, customizable metadata, and async ingestion. Verba can be deployed via pip, built from source, or deployed using Docker. It supports multi-modal data ingestion, including PDFs, CSV/XLSX, .DOCX, and audio files via AssemblyAI. The project is community-driven and welcomes contributions. Known issues include Weaviate Embedded not working on Windows and the lack of multi-user support. The project is licensed under BSD-3-Clause.
