## Summary

These notes provide a concise introduction to machine learning with large-scale graphs, mirroring the topics covered in Stanford's CS224W course. The content is divided into three main areas: Preliminaries, Network Methods, and Machine Learning with Networks.

**Preliminaries** cover basic graph structure, network properties, random graphs, small-world networks, motifs, graphlets, orbits, and ESU.

**Network Methods** include structural roles in networks (RolX, Granovetter, Louvain algorithm), spectral clustering, influence maximization, outbreak detection, link analysis (PageRank, SimRank), network effects and cascading behavior, network robustness, network evolution, and knowledge graphs with metapaths.

**Machine Learning with Networks** focuses on message passing and node classification, node representation learning (shallow, DeepWalk, TransE, node2vec), graph neural networks (GCN, SAGE, GAT), and generative models for graphs (GraphRNN).

The notes are still under construction and open for community improvements via GitHub, with potential bonus points for substantial contributions.
