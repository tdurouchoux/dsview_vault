## Summary

These notes provide an introductory course on machine learning with large-scale graphs, mirroring Stanford CS224W. They are structured into three main areas: Preliminaries, Network Methods, and Machine Learning with Networks.

**Preliminaries** cover basic graph structure, network properties, random graphs, small-world networks, motifs, graphlets, orbits, and ESU.

**Network Methods** include structural roles in networks (RolX, Granovetter, Louvain algorithm), spectral clustering, influence maximization, outbreak detection, link analysis (PageRank, SimRank), network effects and cascading behavior, network robustness, network evolution, and knowledge graphs with metapaths.

**Machine Learning with Networks** focuses on message passing and node classification, node representation learning (shallow, DeepWalk, TransE, node2vec), graph neural networks (GCN, SAGE, GAT), and generative models for graphs (GraphRNN).

The notes are a work in progress, with updates planned as lectures continue. Contributions via GitHub are encouraged and may result in bonus points for the course.
