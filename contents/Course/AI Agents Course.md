## Summary

The ðŸ¤— AI Agents Course by Hugging Face is a comprehensive, free course designed to take participants from beginner to expert in understanding, using, and building AI agents. The course covers theoretical concepts, practical applications, and hands-on experience with popular AI agent libraries such as smolagents, LlamaIndex, and LangGraph.

Key components of the course include:
- **Foundational Units**: Covering the theory behind AI agents.
- **Hands-on Sections**: Practical training using pre-configured environments on Hugging Face Spaces.
- **Use Case Assignments**: Applying learned concepts to real-world problems.
- **Challenges**: Competing against other students' agents on a leaderboard.

The syllabus is structured into several units:
1. **Unit 0**: Onboarding and introduction.
2. **Unit 1**: Introduction to agents.
3. **Unit 2**: Frameworks for AI agents (smolagents, LlamaIndex, LangGraph).
4. **Unit 3**: Use cases for agentic RAG.
5. **Unit 4**: Final project to create, test, and certify an agent.
6. **Bonus Units**: Fine-tuning LLMs for function-calling, agent observability and evaluation, and agents in games with Pokemon.

Prerequisites include basic knowledge of Python and LLMs. Participants need a computer with internet access and a Hugging Face account. The course offers certification options for those who complete specific units and assignments.

The course encourages community engagement through Discord and GitHub, allowing participants to contribute to the course's development and provide feedback. The recommended pace is approximately 3-4 hours per week, with each chapter designed to be completed in one week.
