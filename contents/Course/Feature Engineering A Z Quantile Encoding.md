## Summary

Quantile encoding is a variant of target encoding that uses quantiles instead of means for aggregation, making it more robust to outliers. It employs a formula that combines the quantile of a category with the quantile of the whole dataset, regulated by a hyperparameter \( M \). The main advantage is its reduced sensitivity to outliers compared to target encoding, but it requires tuning of hyperparameters. The Python implementation uses the `QuantileEncoder` method from the `category_encoders` library.
