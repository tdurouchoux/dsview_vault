## Summary

The content is a GitHub repository for a course on aligning small language models (SmolLM2 series). The course is practical, hands-on, and designed to run on local machines with minimal GPU requirements and no paid services. It is open, free, and peer-reviewed, encouraging community involvement through pull requests.

The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of working with small language models:

1. **Instruction Tuning**: Supervised fine-tuning, chat templating, and basic instruction following.
2. **Preference Alignment**: Techniques like DPO and ORPO for aligning models with human preferences.
3. **Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning**: Methods such as LoRA and prompt tuning for efficient adaptation.
4. **Evaluation**: Using automatic benchmarks and creating custom domain evaluations.
5. **Vision-language Models**: Adapting multimodal models for vision-language tasks.
6. **Synthetic Datasets**: Creating and validating synthetic datasets for training.
7. **Inference**: Efficiently inferring with models.
8. **Agents**: Building your own agentic AI.

The course highlights the advantages of small language models, including efficiency, customization, control, cost-effectiveness, privacy, and environmental benefits. Prerequisites include a basic understanding of machine learning, familiarity with Python, PyTorch, and the transformers library, and access to a pre-trained language model and a labeled dataset.

Installation instructions are provided for different environments, including using `uv`, `pip`, and Google Colab. The course is maintained as a package for easy dependency management.
