## Summary

The "smol-course" is a practical course focused on aligning small language models for specific use cases. It emphasizes efficiency, customization, and cost-effectiveness, making it suitable for local machines with minimal GPU requirements. The course is structured into several topics, including instruction tuning, evaluation, preference alignment, reinforcement learning, vision language models, synthetic data, and an award ceremony. It is designed to be community-driven, encouraging participants to contribute and improve the course through peer review and a leaderboard system. The course is based on the SmolLM3 series but can be applied to other small language models. Prerequisites include basic machine learning knowledge, familiarity with Python and PyTorch, and access to a pre-trained language model and labeled dataset. The first version of the course is available in the v1 directory.
