## Summary

This course, "TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing," focuses on efficient machine learning techniques to address the high computational demands of deep neural networks. Key topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, and on-device fine-tuning. The course also covers application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models and diffusion models. Students gain hands-on experience implementing model compression techniques and deploying large language models (Llama2-7B) on laptops.

The course is structured into several chapters:
- **Chapter I: Efficient Inference**: Covers pruning, sparsity, quantization, neural architecture search, and knowledge distillation.
- **Chapter II: Domain-Specific Optimization**: Includes topics on transformers, LLMs, vision transformers, GANs, video, point clouds, and diffusion models.
- **Chapter III: Efficient Training**: Focuses on distributed training, on-device training, transfer learning, and efficient fine-tuning.
- **Chapter IV: Advanced Topics**: Explores quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and noise-robust quantum ML.

The course includes five labs and a final project, with grading based on labs, project proposal, presentation, final report, and participation. Labs cover pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, LLM compression, and LLM deployment on laptops. The final project involves a proposal, oral presentation, and a final report. Participation bonuses can be earned through mid-semester evaluations and other acts that improve the class.
