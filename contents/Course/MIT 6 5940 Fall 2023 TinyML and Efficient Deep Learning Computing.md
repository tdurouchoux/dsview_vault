## Summary

The course "TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning Computing" at MIT focuses on efficient machine learning techniques to enable deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Key topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, and on-device fine-tuning. The course also covers application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models and diffusion models. Students gain hands-on experience implementing model compression techniques and deploying large language models (Llama2-7B) on a laptop.

The course is structured into several chapters:
1. Efficient Inference: Covers pruning, sparsity, quantization, and neural architecture search.
2. Domain-Specific Optimization: Includes transformers, LLMs, vision transformers, GANs, video, and point cloud processing.
3. Efficient Training: Focuses on distributed training, on-device training, transfer learning, and efficient fine-tuning.
4. Advanced Topics: Explores quantum computing, quantum machine learning, and noise-robust quantum ML.

Grading is based on five labs (15% each) and a final project (25%), which includes a proposal (5%), presentation and final report (20%), and a participation bonus (4%). Labs must be done individually but collaboration is allowed. The course does not have any tests or exams.
