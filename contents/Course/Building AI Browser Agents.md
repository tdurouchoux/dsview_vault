## Summary

This course, "Building AI Browser Agents," taught by Div Garg and Naman Garg, focuses on creating AI agents that interact with websites. Key topics include:

- **Fundamentals of Autonomous Web Agents**: Understanding their architecture, components, limitations, and decision-making strategies.
- **Building Web Agents**: Creating agents that can scrape websites, summarize content, fill out forms, and sign up for newsletters.
- **AgentQ Framework**: Utilizing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), self-critique mechanisms, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for self-correction.
- **MCTS Deep Dive**: Learning how MCTS finds optimal paths and applying it to web tasks.
- **Future of AI Agents**: Exploring current state and future directions, including hardware, algorithms, and data availability.

The course is ideal for learners with basic Python skills and includes 8 video lessons and 3 code examples. It is currently offered for free during the DeepLearning.AI platform beta.
