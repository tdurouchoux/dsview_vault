## Summary

This codelab guides web developers through creating a web app that replicates Google's "Teachable Machine" using transfer learning with TensorFlow.js. The app allows users to recognize custom objects with just a few example images from their webcam.

Key points:

- **TensorFlow.js**: An open-source machine learning library for JavaScript, enabling ML across web browsers, servers, IoT devices, and mobile apps.
- **Transfer Learning**: Reusing a pre-trained model (like MobileNet) to perform a different but related task, saving time and resources.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: A repository of pre-trained models for transfer learning, including MobileNet v3 for image feature vectors.
- **App Development**: The codelab walks through setting up a web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including enabling the webcam, collecting data, training a model, and making predictions.
- **Model Training**: The app uses a multi-layer perceptron to classify new objects based on features extracted by MobileNet.
- **Real-time Prediction**: The app provides real-time classification of objects from the webcam feed after training.

The codelab emphasizes the advantages of transfer learning, such as faster training times, reduced data requirements, and suitability for browser environments. It also highlights the privacy, speed, reach, and cost benefits of running ML models in the web browser.
