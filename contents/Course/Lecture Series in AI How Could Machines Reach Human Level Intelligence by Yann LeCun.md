## Summary

Yann LeCun, a prominent figure in AI, discusses the path to human-level intelligence in machines. He emphasizes that current AI systems, like deep learning, are limited to pattern recognition and lack true understanding or common sense. LeCun proposes that machines need to learn from their environment and interactions, similar to how humans learn. He introduces the concept of "world models," where machines build an internal representation of the world to make predictions and decisions. Key points include the importance of self-supervised learning, the role of curiosity and exploration, and the need for AI systems to understand causality. LeCun also touches on the ethical implications and the potential impact of achieving human-level AI.
