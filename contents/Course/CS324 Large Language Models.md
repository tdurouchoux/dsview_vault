## Summary

This course, CS324, focuses on large language models (LLMs) and their impact on natural language processing (NLP). It covers the fundamentals of modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects of LLMs, as well as hands-on experience working with them. The course is structured into lectures and discussions, with grades based on paper reviews, discussions, and two projects. The first project involves evaluating language models like GPT-3, while the second project focuses on building and improving models like BERT-base. Coursework is submitted via Gradescope, with specific guidelines for late submissions and regrades. The course aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of LLMs, their capabilities, and their risks.
