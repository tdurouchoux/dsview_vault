## Summary

The course CS324 focuses on large language models, covering their modeling, theory, ethics, and systems aspects. It is structured into lectures and discussions, with students required to review papers and participate in panel discussions. The coursework consists of two main components: paper reviews and discussions (20% of the grade), and two projects (80% of the grade). The first project involves evaluating language models like GPT-3, while the second project focuses on building models like BERT-base. Both projects should be done in groups of 1-2 students and submitted as PDFs. The course uses Ed for announcements and questions, Canvas for resources, and Gradescope for submissions. Late submissions are allowed with a limited number of late days, and regrade requests must be submitted within one week of grade release.
