## Summary

The Carnegie Mellon University Database Research Group is hosting the "SQL or Death?" Seminar Series in Spring 2025, exploring the future of SQL. The series will feature talks on either optimizing SQL for speed or replacing it with better alternatives. The seminars are open to the public and will be held online via Zoom on Mondays at 4:30pm ET. Videos will be posted on the CMU-DB YouTube Channel after each talk.

Key talks include:
- James Cowling on TypeScript Stored Procedures
- Viktor Leis and Thomas Neumann on Query Language Sanity
- Yash Mayya and Gonzalo Ortiz on Apache Pinot Query Optimizer
- Jeff Shute on Pipe Syntax in SQL
- Lloyd Tabb on Malloy, a modern open-source data analysis language
- Tobias Brandt on PRQL (Pipelined Relational Query Language)
- Kaisen Kang on StarRocks Query Optimizer
- Ben Naecker on OxQL (Oximeter Query Language)
- Michael Widenius on MariaDBâ€™s Query Optimizer
- Michael Sullivan on Gel, a potential SQL replacement

The series is organized by Andy Pavlo, Jignesh Patel, and Sam Madden.

- [PRQL: Pipelined Relational Query Language](https://prql-lang.org/) : PRQL is a modern query language designed to be more intuitive and expressive than SQL. It focuses on a pipelined approach to data manipulation, making it easier to write and understand complex queries.
- [Apache Pinot](https://pinot.apache.org/) : Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore. It is designed to answer OLAP queries with low latency and handle high QPS. It is used for real-time analytics and feature stores.
- [Malloy Data](https://www.malloydata.dev/) : Malloy is a modern open-source language for analyzing, transforming, and modeling data. It aims to provide a more user-friendly and powerful alternative to SQL for data analysis.
- [StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io/) : StarRocks is a high-performance, real-time analytics database designed for sub-second OLAP queries. It supports SQL and integrates with various data sources for real-time analytics.
- [Gel Data](https://www.geldata.com/) : Gel is a new database model that aims to replace SQL and improve on the relational database model. It focuses on providing a more flexible and efficient way to handle data.
