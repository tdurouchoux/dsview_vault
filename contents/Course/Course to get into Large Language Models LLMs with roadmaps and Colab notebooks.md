## Summary

The course is divided into three main parts: LLM Fundamentals, LLM Scientist, and LLM Engineer.

**LLM Fundamentals** covers essential knowledge about mathematics, Python, and neural networks. It includes topics like linear algebra, calculus, probability and statistics, Python basics, data science libraries, data preprocessing, machine learning libraries, neural networks, NLP, text preprocessing, feature extraction techniques, word embeddings, and recurrent neural networks.

**LLM Scientist** focuses on building the best possible LLMs using the latest techniques. It includes topics like LLM architecture, pre-training models, post-training datasets, supervised fine-tuning, preference alignment, evaluation, quantization, and new trends like model merging, multimodal models, interpretability, and test-time compute scaling.

**LLM Engineer** focuses on creating LLM-based applications and deploying them. It includes topics like running LLMs, building a vector storage, retrieval augmented generation, advanced RAG, agents, inference optimization, deploying LLMs, and securing LLMs.

The course also provides a list of notebooks and tools related to LLMs, such as LLM AutoEval, LazyMergekit, LazyAxolotl, AutoQuant, Model Family Tree, ZeroSpace, and AutoAbliteration.

The course is based on the LLM Engineer's Handbook, a hands-on and detailed book that covers an end-to-end LLM application from design to deployment. The course will always stay free, but you can support the author's work by purchasing the book.
