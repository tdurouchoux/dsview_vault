## Summary

The Programme 10% is a collaborative initiative between public data and AI experts from the French government. It focuses on projects that have a common interest, concrete impact, and open data. The program is structured into three phases:

1. **Investigation Phase (January-February):** Teams form, identify use cases, and develop project ideas.
2. **Construction Phase (March-June):** Teams work on technical solutions, test them, and present them during a demo day.
3. **Amplification Phase (September-November):** Projects are proposed to other administrations, with support provided throughout this phase, culminating in presentations during the month of public innovation in November.

**Season 3 Projects:**
- **KALLM:** A practical guide for implementing Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **MatchCV:** An tool to optimize recruitment and help candidates find suitable jobs in the public sector.
- **ChartsGouv:** A unified, open-source tool for data visualization within the administration.
- **Cartiflette:** A tool for creating geographic maps using public map funds.
