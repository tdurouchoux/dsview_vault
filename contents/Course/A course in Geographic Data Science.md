## Summary

This course, "Geographic Data Science," is offered by the University of Liverpool and focuses on the intersection of Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Data Science. It is designed to teach students how to integrate modern GIS tools with Data Science techniques to address real-world problems. The course is structured into several key sections:

1. **Introduction**: Covers the basics of Geographic Data Science and open science practices in both R and Python.
2. **Spatial Data**: Introduces the handling and manipulation of spatial data.
3. **Mapping Vector Data**: Focuses on creating and interpreting maps using vector data.
4. **Mapping Raster Data**: Covers the creation and interpretation of maps using raster data.
5. **Points**: Deals with the analysis and visualization of point data.
6. **Spatial Weights**: Explores the concept of spatial weights and their applications.
7. **ESDA (Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis)**: Introduces techniques for exploring spatial data.
8. **Clustering**: Covers clustering techniques for spatial data analysis.
9. **Spatial Networks**: Focuses on the analysis of spatial networks.

The course is designed to be flexible, allowing students to choose between R and Python for their lab sessions. The material is inspired by Dani Arribas-Bel’s course on Geographic Data Science and is available for free under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International license.
