## Summary

This course, CS 329S, focuses on designing machine learning systems that are deployable, reliable, and scalable. It covers data management, feature engineering, model selection, scaling, monitoring, deployment, and the human aspects of ML projects, including privacy, fairness, and security. The course is structured with lectures and tutorials, and students are expected to have a background in computer science, machine learning algorithms, and at least one ML framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The grading is based on a final project (65%), short assignments (30%), and discussion participation (5%). The course is open to auditing requests by Stanford students and staff, and all materials will be made publicly available. The course is in its second iteration, with materials being more developed but still evolving. Python fluency is recommended but not required.
