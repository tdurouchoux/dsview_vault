## Summary

The Hugging Face Model Context Protocol (MCP) Course, developed in partnership with Anthropic, is designed to educate participants on understanding, using, and building applications with MCP. The course is structured into foundational units, hands-on sessions, and use case assignments, with collaborations from Hugging Face's partners providing the latest MCP implementations and tools. The syllabus includes onboarding, MCP fundamentals, end-to-end use cases, deployed use cases, and bonus units. Prerequisites include a basic understanding of AI, LLM concepts, software development principles, and experience with at least one programming language. Participants need a computer with an internet connection and an account to access course resources. The certification process is free and involves completing specific units for different certificates. The recommended pace is one chapter per week, with approximately 3-4 hours of work. Participants are encouraged to join study groups, complete quizzes and assignments, and define a schedule. The course is authored by Ben Burtenshaw and Alex Notov, with contributions from various partners. Participants can report bugs, suggest improvements, and ask questions through the course's Discord server.
