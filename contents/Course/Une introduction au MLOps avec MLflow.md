## Summary

The content introduces MLOps using MLflow, a platform for managing the machine learning lifecycle. Key points include the challenges of transitioning from ML experiments to production, the principles of MLOps (reproducibility, version control, automation, monitoring, collaboration), and the advantages of MLflow (open-source, covers the entire ML model lifecycle, framework-agnostic). The content also discusses the SSP Cloud platform, which provides resources for data science projects. The main sections cover an introduction to MLflow, a concrete example of predicting business codes, serving ML models to users, maintaining models in production, and distributing hyperparameter optimization. The content emphasizes the importance of monitoring models in production and provides examples of using Argo Workflows for distributed training. The conclusion highlights the need for continuous transformation at technical, methodological, and organizational levels, with a strategy of incremental change through training and pilot projects.
