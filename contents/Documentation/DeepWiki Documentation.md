## Summary

**Key Technical Points:**

- **DeepWiki**: Automatically indexes repositories and generates wikis with architecture diagrams, documentation, and code summaries.
- **Integration**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and other platforms.
- **Configuration**: Uses a `.devin/wiki.json` file to steer wiki generation, especially useful for large repositories.
- **Configuration Options**:
  - `repo_notes`: Provides context and guidance for documentation.
  - `pages`: Specifies which pages should be created, with options for hierarchical organization.
- **Validation Limits**: Maximum of 30 pages, 100 total notes, and 10,000 characters per note.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use `repo_notes` strategically to prioritize important parts of the codebase.
  - Organize pages logically with clear hierarchies.
  - Be specific in page purposes to ensure accurate documentation.
  - Address known gaps by explicitly including missing components.
- **Troubleshooting**: Solutions for common issues like missing folders or components, involving the use of `.devin/wiki.json` for explicit documentation.

**Key Takeaways:**

- DeepWiki automates the generation of comprehensive documentation for repositories.
- Configuration file `.devin/wiki.json` allows for customization and control over the documentation process.
- Best practices and troubleshooting tips ensure accurate and complete documentation, especially for large repositories.
