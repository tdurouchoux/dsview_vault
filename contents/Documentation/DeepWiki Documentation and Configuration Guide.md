## Summary

DeepWiki is a tool that automatically indexes repositories and generates wikis with architecture diagrams, links to sources, and code summaries. It helps users understand unfamiliar codebases and is integrated with Ask Devin for context-aware queries. DeepWiki is autogenerated during repository onboarding and also available for public GitHub repositories at deepwiki.com.

To steer DeepWiki's behavior, a `.devin/wiki.json` file can be created in the repository's root directory. This file can include `repo_notes` for context and guidance, and `pages` to specify which pages should be created. The configuration has validation limits, such as a maximum of 30 pages and 100 total notes.

Practical examples demonstrate how to use repo notes to guide wiki generation, ensure specific folders are documented, address missing components, and create hierarchical documentation structures. Best practices include using repo notes strategically, organizing pages logically, being specific in page purposes, and addressing known gaps.

Common issues and their solutions are also provided, such as ensuring all important folders and components are documented. To get started, create a `.devin/wiki.json` file, add repo notes and/or pages, and commit the file to regenerate the wiki with explicit instructions.
