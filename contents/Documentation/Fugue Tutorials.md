## Summary

Fugue is a tool that simplifies distributed computing by minimizing code and optimizing execution across Spark, Dask, and Ray. It ports Python, Pandas, and SQL code to these backends, ensuring consistency and efficiency. Fugue does not aim to replace Pandas but encourages using each tool's strengths. It supports both Python and SQL (via FugueSQL) and integrates with various data stores and cloud providers. Fugue guarantees consistent results across backends and is incrementally adoptable. It also integrates with Polars and DuckDB for local prototyping and scaling. Installation is straightforward via pip, with backend engines installed separately. Tutorials can be run interactively using mybinder or a local Docker image.
