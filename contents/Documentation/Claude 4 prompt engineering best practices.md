## Summary

**Concise Summary:**

The document outlines prompt engineering best practices for Claude 4 models (Opus 4.1, Opus 4, and Sonnet 4), emphasizing explicit instructions, context provision, and attention to details. Key strategies include:

1. **General Principles:**
   - Be clear and specific with instructions.
   - Provide context to improve performance.
   - Use examples and details to guide behavior.

2. **Specific Guidance:**
   - Control response format by telling Claude what to do, using XML tags, and matching prompt style to desired output.
   - Leverage thinking capabilities for complex tasks and parallel tool calling.
   - Reduce file creation in agentic coding by instructing cleanup.
   - Enhance frontend code generation with explicit encouragement and details.
   - Avoid focusing solely on passing tests; prioritize general, robust solutions.

3. **Migration Considerations:**
   - Be specific about desired behavior and features when migrating from Sonnet 3.7 to Claude 4.

The document also mentions tools like the Prompt Generator and Prompt Improver, and highlights the importance of testing and evaluating prompts.
