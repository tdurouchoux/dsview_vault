## Summary

This book by Nathan Lambert provides an introduction to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), focusing on its application to language models. It covers the origins of RLHF, its problem formulation, data collection, and common mathematical concepts used in the literature. The core of the book details the optimization stages of RLHF, including instruction tuning, training a reward model, rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. Advanced topics such as synthetic data, evaluation, and open questions in the field are also discussed. The book has been updated with new chapters and improvements, including a chapter on tool use and enhancements to sections on reasoning, evaluation, and policy gradient methods. The author acknowledges contributions from various individuals and GitHub contributors.
