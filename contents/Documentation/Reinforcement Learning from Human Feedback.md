## Summary

This book by Nathan Lambert provides an introduction to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), focusing on its application to language models. It covers the origins of RLHF, its problem formulation, data collection, and common mathematical concepts used in the literature. The core of the book details the optimization stages of RLHF, including instruction tuning, reward model training, rejection sampling, reinforcement learning, and direct alignment algorithms. Advanced topics such as synthetic data, evaluation, and open research questions are also discussed. The book has been updated with new chapters and improvements, including additions on tool use, RLVR/reasoning, evaluation, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The author acknowledges contributions from various individuals and GitHub contributors. The book is available online and can be cited using the provided reference.
