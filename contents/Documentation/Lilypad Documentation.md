## Summary

Lilypad is a documentation platform for working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It outlines a typical LLM development flow: Prototype, Vibe Check, Annotate, Analyze, Optimize, and Iterate. Key points include:

1. **Prototype**: Use the open-source LLM library Mirascope for easy prototyping.
2. **Vibe Check**: Evaluate initial outputs and refine prompts.
3. **Annotate**: Label data systematically, including inputs, outputs, and trace details.
4. **Analyze**: Identify trends and compare different versions.
5. **Optimize**: Apply insights to improve the system.
6. **Iterate**: Repeat the process until the system is deemed satisfactory.

Lilypad provides tools for observability, versioning, and evaluation, addressing gaps in current observability tools by offering a comprehensive data flywheel. It supports tracking, annotating, and comparing LLM function versions, with features like cost and latency monitoring, and comparison of different implementations.
