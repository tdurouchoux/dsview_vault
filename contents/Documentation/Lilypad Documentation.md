## Summary

Lilypad is a documentation platform for an open-source LLM library called Mirascope, designed to simplify the development flow with Large Language Models (LLMs). The typical development process involves six steps: Prototype, Vibe Check, Annotate, Analyze, Optimize, and Iterate. Lilypad addresses the need for a data flywheel that includes data storage, querying, annotation, and version tracking, which are not fully covered by traditional observability tools. It provides these capabilities in one line of code, making it easier to manage and improve LLM systems. The documentation also includes sections on getting started, observability features like spans and traces, and evaluation tools for cost, latency, comparisons, and annotations.
