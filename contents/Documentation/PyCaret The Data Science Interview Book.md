## Summary

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code Python library for automating machine learning workflows. It simplifies and speeds up the experiment cycle by reducing hundreds of lines of code to just a few. PyCaret is a wrapper around popular libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and others.

Key features include:

1. **Setup**: Initializes the training environment, handles data preprocessing tasks like missing value imputation, encoding, outlier treatment, and feature engineering.

2. **Train & Optimize**: Provides functions to compare, evaluate, and optimize models. It supports hyperparameter tuning, stacking, ensembling, and model interpretation using SHAP values.

3. **Predict & Deploy**: Generates predictions, monitors data drift, and supports deployment on cloud platforms like GCP, AWS, and Azure.

PyCaret supports various tasks such as regression, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, NLP, association rule mining, and time series analysis.
