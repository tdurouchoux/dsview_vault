## Summary

PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates workflows, speeding up the experiment cycle. It's a wrapper around libraries like scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and others.

**Key Features:**

1. **Setup**: Initializes the training environment, handles data preprocessing like imputation, encoding, scaling, and feature engineering.

2. **Train & Optimize**: Automates model training and evaluation using cross-validation. Offers model tuning, stacking, ensembling, and model analysis with `evaluate_model` and `interpret_model` commands.

3. **Predict & Deploy**: Generates predictions, monitors data drift, and supports deployment on GCP, AWS, and Azure.

PyCaret supports various tasks including Regression, Classification, Clustering, Anomaly Detection, NLP, Association Rule Mining, and Time Series.
