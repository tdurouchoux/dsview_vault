## Summary

This resource focuses on dashboard design patterns, aiming to support and streamline the design process. Dashboards are tools that provide a curated view of complex data, offering insights at a glance and are widely used across various domains. The page lists design patterns derived from research published at the IEEE VIS Conference. Key points include the challenges of dashboard design due to the vast number of data streams, visual representations, and structural choices available. The resource aims to address the need for guidance, especially for non-expert designers. It offers downloadable pattern cheatsheets and mentions a dedicated workshop held in March 2022 to help apply these patterns. The team behind this resource includes academics from several universities.
