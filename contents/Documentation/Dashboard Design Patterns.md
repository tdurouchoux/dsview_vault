## Summary

This content discusses dashboard design patterns, which are collected to aid in the design and creative exploration of dashboards. The patterns are derived from research published in the IEEE VIS Conference/Journal of Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) in 2023.

**Key Points:**

- **What are Dashboards?**
  Dashboards provide a curated view of large and complex datasets, using visual representations to simplify and abstract data points. They are widely used across various domains like business, healthcare, public health, learning analytics, and more.

- **Why Design Patterns?**
  Despite numerous high-level guidelines on dashboard design, there is a lack of effective and applicable design principles. The vast number of choices in data streams, visual representations, and presentation structures can be overwhelming. Design patterns aim to streamline the dashboard design process, especially for non-expert designers.

- **Dashboard Design Workshop**
  A workshop was held in March 2022 to help designers learn about and apply these patterns. The workshop is open and online, with more information available via the provided link.

- **Team**
  The research and patterns are developed by a team from various universities, including the University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, Kingâ€™s College London, University of Warwick, and University of Oxford.

The content also provides downloadable cheatsheets for the design patterns and information on the hosting platform (GitHub Pages).
