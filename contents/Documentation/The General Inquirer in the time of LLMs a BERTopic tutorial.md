## Summary

BERTopic is a Python library for topic modeling that leverages embeddings from pre-trained transformer models. It is used to extract latent topics from a corpus of text documents. The BERTopic pipeline involves three main steps: generating embeddings, clustering documents based on embeddings, and retrieving keywords to describe topics. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to use BERTopic, including preprocessing data, creating a BERTopic object, fitting and transforming the model, and visualizing results. It also covers advanced practices such as aggregating topics, tuning parameters, and evaluating the topic model. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of qualitative evaluation and provides tips for reproducibility and reducing computation time. The limits of BERTopic and topic modeling in general are also discussed.
