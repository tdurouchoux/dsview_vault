## Summary

LangChain is a framework designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for various applications like chatbots, generative question-answering, and summarization. The LangChain AI Handbook, authored by James Briggs and Francisco Ingham, provides a comprehensive guide to using LangChain effectively. The handbook is structured into several chapters, each focusing on different aspects of LangChain:

1. **Introduction and Getting Started**: Covers the core components of LangChain.
2. **Prompt Engineering and LLMs**: Discusses the art of designing effective prompts.
3. **Composable Pipelines with Chains**: Explores modularity and composability in LangChain.
4. **Conversational Memory**: Focuses on enhancing chatbots with conversational memory.
5. **Fixing Hallucination with Knowledge Bases**: Addresses the issue of hallucinations in LLMs using external knowledge bases.
6. **Conversational Agents**: Examines how ReAct and conversational agents can enhance LLMs with tools.
7. **Custom Tools for LLM Agents**: Details the process of building custom tools for agents.
8. **Agents With Long-Term Memory**: Explores the creation of retrieval-augmented conversational agents.
9. **Streaming in LangChain**: Provides a guide on streaming in LangChain, from simple to complex scenarios.
10. **Multi-Query for RAG**: Explains the use of multi-query in RAG pipelines.
11. **LangChain Expression Language**: Introduces LCEL and its functionality.

The handbook aims to empower developers to build intelligent applications using LangChain, transforming interactions with technology. Additionally, the case study highlights Delphi's use of Pinecone to create over 100 million conversational agents, with less than 30% of the total response time spent on retrieval.
