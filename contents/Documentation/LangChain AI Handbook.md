## Summary

LangChain is a framework designed to leverage large language models (LLMs) for various applications like chatbots, generative question-answering, and summarization. The LangChain AI Handbook, authored by James Briggs and Francisco Ingham, provides a comprehensive guide to using LangChain effectively. The handbook is structured into several chapters, each focusing on different aspects of LangChain:

1. **Introduction and Getting Started**: Overview of LangChain's core components.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques for designing effective prompts.
3. **Composable Pipelines**: Building modular and composable pipelines using chains.
4. **Conversational Memory**: Enhancing chatbots with conversational memory.
5. **Knowledge Bases**: Using external knowledge bases to combat hallucinations and keep LLMs updated.
6. **Conversational Agents**: Supercharging LLMs with tools and ReAct.
7. **Custom Tools**: Building custom tools for agent use.
8. **Long-Term Memory**: Creating retrieval-augmented conversational agents.
9. **Streaming**: Implementing streaming in LangChain.
10. **Multi-Query for RAG**: Utilizing multi-query in RAG pipelines.
11. **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**: Understanding and using LCEL.

The handbook aims to empower developers to create intelligent applications by harnessing the full potential of LangChain and LLMs.
