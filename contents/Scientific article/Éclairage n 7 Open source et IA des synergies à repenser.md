## Summary

The document discusses the intersection of open source and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the generative AI (IAG) sector. It highlights the rapid advancements in AI, particularly in generative models that produce synthetic content like text, sounds, images, and videos. The document explores the use of open source resources and licenses by key players in this ecosystem, questioning whether the current framework remains suitable for their development. It aims to evaluate the adaptability of these licenses to foster sustainable and balanced innovation. The PEReN (Pôle d’Expertise de la Régulation Numérique) provides support to state services regulating digital platforms and engages in exploratory data science research. The document also mentions a comparator tool for assessing the openness of AI models.
