## Summary

The document discusses the intersection of open source and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on the generative AI (IAG) sector. It highlights the rapid growth and widespread availability of AI-generated content, powered by deep learning models trained on vast datasets. The document explores the use of open source licenses by key players in this ecosystem and evaluates whether these licenses are still suitable for fostering sustainable and balanced innovation. It also mentions a comparator tool for assessing the openness of AI models. The PEReN, a French digital regulation expertise center, provides support to government services and engages in exploratory data science research.
