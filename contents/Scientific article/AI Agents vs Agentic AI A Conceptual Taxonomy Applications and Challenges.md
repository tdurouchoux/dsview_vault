## Summary

The document presents a comprehensive review of AI Agents and Agentic AI, focusing on their technical points and key takeaways. It begins by distinguishing between AI Agents and Agentic AI, offering a structured taxonomy, application mapping, and analysis of opportunities and challenges. The study outlines the search strategy and foundational definitions, characterizing AI Agents as modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. Generative AI is positioned as a precursor, providing the foundation for AI agents to advance through tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements. The document then characterizes Agentic AI systems, which represent a paradigm shift marked by multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy. The comparative analysis across both AI agents and Agentic AI paradigms highlights their divergent design philosophies and capabilities. The study also surveys application domains, showcasing the deployment of AI Agents in customer support, scheduling, and data summarization, and Agentic AI in research automation, robotic coordination, and medical decision support. It further examines unique challenges in each paradigm, including hallucination, brittleness, emergent behavior, and coordination failure, and proposes targeted solutions such as ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, and causal modeling. The document aims to provide a roadmap for developing robust, scalable, and explainable AI-driven systems.
