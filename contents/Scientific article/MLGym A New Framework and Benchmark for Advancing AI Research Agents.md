## Summary

The paper introduces MLGym, a new framework and benchmark for evaluating and developing large language model (LLM) agents on AI research tasks. MLGym consists of two main components: Meta MLGym, a framework for training and evaluating agents, and MLGym-Bench, a benchmark with 13 diverse AI research tasks across domains like computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and game theory. These tasks require real-world AI research skills such as hypothesis generation, data processing, model implementation, and experimentation.

The authors evaluate several frontier LLMs, including Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1 405B, GPT-4o, o1-preview, and Gemini-1.5 Pro, on the benchmark. They find that while current models can improve on baselines, they do not generate novel hypotheses, algorithms, or substantial improvements. The MLGym framework is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for the addition of new tasks, integration of models, synthetic data generation, and development of new learning algorithms.

The paper concludes by open-sourcing the framework and benchmark to facilitate future research in advancing the AI research capabilities of LLM agents.
