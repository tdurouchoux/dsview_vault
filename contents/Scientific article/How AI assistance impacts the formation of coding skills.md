## Summary

The study investigates the impact of AI assistance on the formation of coding skills, focusing on whether AI's productivity benefits come with trade-offs in skill development. A randomized controlled trial with 52 software developers found that using AI assistance led to a statistically significant decrease in mastery of a new Python library, with participants scoring 17% lower on a quiz compared to those who coded by hand. While AI use slightly sped up task completion, this was not statistically significant.

Key findings include:

1. **Skill Development**: AI assistance hindered the understanding of code, particularly in debugging skills.
2. **Interaction Patterns**: The way participants interacted with AI affected learning outcomes. High-scoring participants used AI for conceptual queries and follow-up questions, while low-scoring participants relied heavily on AI for code generation and debugging.
3. **Trade-offs**: Aggressive AI incorporation in the workplace may lead to productivity gains at the cost of skill development, which is crucial for validating AI-written code and providing oversight.

The study suggests that intentional design choices and policies are needed to ensure that AI tools facilitate learning and skill development, particularly for junior developers. It also highlights the importance of cognitive effort and independent problem-solving in fostering mastery.
