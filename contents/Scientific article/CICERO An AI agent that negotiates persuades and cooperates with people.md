## Summary

CICERO is an AI agent developed by Meta that has achieved human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy, which involves negotiation, persuasion, and cooperation. Unlike games like Chess and Go, Diplomacy requires understanding other players' motivations, making complex plans, and using natural language to form alliances.

CICERO combines strategic reasoning and natural language processing techniques. It uses a controllable dialogue model fine-tuned on human games and a strategic reasoning engine called piKL. The agent predicts other players' actions, forms intents, generates dialogue, and filters messages to ensure they are sensible and strategically sound.

CICERO's performance highlights the potential for AI to cooperate with humans effectively. However, it sometimes generates inconsistent dialogue, indicating room for improvement. The code has been open-sourced to advance research in human-AI interaction responsibly.

The technology behind CICERO could have real-world applications, such as improving communication between humans and AI assistants or enhancing NPC interactions in video games.
