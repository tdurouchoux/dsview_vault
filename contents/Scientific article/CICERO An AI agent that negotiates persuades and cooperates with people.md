## Summary

Meta AI Research introduced CICERO, an AI agent that excels in negotiation, persuasion, and cooperation, achieving human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy. Unlike games like Chess or Go, Diplomacy requires understanding human motivations, complex planning, and natural language processing for effective negotiation.

CICERO combines strategic reasoning and natural language processing, using a controllable dialogue model and a strategic reasoning engine. It analyzes the game board and conversation history to predict other players' actions and generate dialogue that aligns with its strategic plans. The agent's dialogue model is fine-tuned on human games and uses techniques to ensure sensible, consistent, and strategically sound communication.

CICERO's strategic planning involves an iterative algorithm called piKL, which balances dialogue consistency with rationality. This approach improves upon supervised learning by making plans that are consistent with dialogue and more aligned with human behavior.

While CICERO demonstrates significant advancements, it sometimes generates inconsistent dialogue. The research team has open-sourced the code and data to encourage further progress in human-AI cooperation. They also highlight the potential for future applications in areas like AI assistants and video games with more human-like NPCs.

The research underscores the importance of aligning AI with human intentions and objectives, particularly in environments involving cooperation and competition. Diplomacy serves as a valuable sandbox for advancing research in human-AI interaction.
