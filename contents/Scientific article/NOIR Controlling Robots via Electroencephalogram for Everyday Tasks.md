## Summary

NOIR is a system designed to control robots using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for everyday tasks. Developed by Ruohan Zhang and colleagues at Stanford, NOIR enables users to perform complex actions by breaking them down into simple thoughts, such as selecting an object, choosing an action, and specifying a location on the object. The system uses EEG electrodes to capture brain signals and employs Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) classifiers to interpret these signals. Users can select objects and actions by focusing on specific body parts or a cross displayed on a screen. The system also includes an R3M embedding model to suggest commonly selected objects and actions, making it more user-friendly. In tests, three users successfully controlled two robots to execute 20 everyday tasks, with varying accuracies in object, action, and location selection. The key takeaway is that simple statistical techniques can effectively decode complex brain signals for practical applications.
