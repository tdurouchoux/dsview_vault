## Summary

This paper reviews the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in financial fraud detection. It highlights the increasing complexity of financial transactions due to global economic integration and technological advancements, which pose significant challenges in detecting fraud. The review proposes a unified framework to categorize existing GNN methodologies used in financial fraud detection. It explores the suitability of GNNs for this task, their real-world deployment, and design considerations that enhance their effectiveness. The paper finds that GNNs excel at capturing complex relational patterns and dynamics within financial networks, outperforming traditional fraud detection methods. Unlike previous surveys, this review provides a comprehensive, structured analysis of GNNs' applications and deployments in financial fraud detection. It also identifies current gaps and outlines future research directions to improve their deployment in financial systems. The review is based on a structured analysis of over 100 studies, contributing to the understanding of GNN applications in this field.
