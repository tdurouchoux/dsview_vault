## Summary

This review paper explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in financial fraud detection, highlighting their superiority over traditional methods. It proposes a unified framework categorizing existing GNN methodologies and addresses key research questions about their suitability, real-world deployment, and design considerations. The paper emphasizes GNNs' ability to capture complex relational patterns in financial networks, summarizing insights from over 100 studies. It also identifies current gaps and outlines future research directions, contributing to the understanding of GNNs' potential in enhancing fraud detection mechanisms.
