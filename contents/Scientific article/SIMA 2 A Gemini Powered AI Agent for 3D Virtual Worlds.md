## Summary

SIMA 2, developed by Google DeepMind, is an advanced AI agent that operates in 3D virtual worlds, building upon the capabilities of its predecessor, SIMA. Powered by Gemini models, SIMA 2 can follow instructions, reason about goals, converse with users, and improve over time. It demonstrates enhanced reasoning, generalization, and self-improvement capabilities, making it a significant step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and has implications for robotics and AI embodiment. SIMA 2 was trained using a mix of human demonstration videos and Gemini-generated labels, enabling it to describe its actions and intentions to users. It shows improved performance in understanding complex instructions and executing them successfully, even in new, unseen games like ASKA and MineDojo. The agent's ability to generalize learned concepts across different games brings it closer to human-like cognition. Additionally, SIMA 2 can operate in newly generated worlds created by Genie 3, demonstrating adaptability. One of its most exciting features is self-improvement, where it can learn and develop skills in new games through self-directed play, reducing the need for human intervention. Despite its advancements, SIMA 2 faces challenges with long-horizon tasks, memory limitations, and precise action execution. The research validates a new path in action-oriented AI and offers potential applications in robotics. Google DeepMind is committed to responsible development and is providing early access to academics and game developers for feedback and further exploration.
