## Summary

The document discusses the limitations of the traditional hierarchical file system (HFS) for document storage and retrieval, highlighting issues such as the inability to store a document in multiple folders, the lack of labeled metadata, and the difficulty in retrieving documents based on different criteria. The author proposes a new approach called Newdocms, which allows users to store document metadata as (attribute, value) pairs and organize concepts into a category tree. This system enables more flexible and powerful document retrieval, as well as the ability to define document shortcuts and collections. The author also explains how documents are stored and retrieved in Newdocms, and provides a step-by-step example of how the system works. The document concludes with a call for volunteers to help modify the GNOME and OpenOffice.org libraries to support Newdocms, and a reflection on the innovative potential of free software.
