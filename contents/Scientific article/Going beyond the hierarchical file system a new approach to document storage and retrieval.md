## Summary

The document discusses a critique of the traditional hierarchical file system (HFS) and introduces an alternative approach called Newdocms. The author argues that the HFS, which organizes documents in a tree-like structure, has several limitations such as the inability to store a document in multiple folders, the need to encode metadata into file paths, and the difficulty of retrieving documents based on different criteria. Newdocms aims to address these issues by allowing users to store document metadata as (attribute, value) pairs. It introduces concepts and text attributes, enabling users to define relationships between documents and concepts. The system also supports a category tree for organizing concepts hierarchically, providing a form of ontological intelligence. Newdocms includes features like document shortcuts, collections, and a flat storage system for documents. The author provides a step-by-step example of how to use Newdocms and concludes by discussing the potential for further development and the benefits of free software in enabling such innovations.
