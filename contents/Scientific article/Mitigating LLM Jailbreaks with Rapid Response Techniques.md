## Summary

The paper introduces a new approach called "Jailbreak Rapid Response" to mitigate misuse of large language models (LLMs). Instead of aiming for perfect adversarial robustness, the authors propose rapid response techniques to block classes of jailbreaks after observing only a few attacks. They develop RapidResponseBench, a benchmark to evaluate the robustness of defenses against various jailbreak strategies after adapting to observed examples. The study evaluates five rapid response methods, all using jailbreak proliferation to generate additional jailbreaks similar to observed examples. The strongest method, fine-tuning an input classifier to block proliferated jailbreaks, reduces the attack success rate by over 240 times on in-distribution jailbreaks and over 15 times on out-of-distribution jailbreaks, having observed just one example of each jailbreaking strategy. The quality of the proliferation model and the number of proliferated examples play a key role in the effectiveness of this defense. The paper highlights the potential of rapid response techniques in limiting LLM misuse and suggests further research to improve real-time jailbreak detection and rapid response methods.
