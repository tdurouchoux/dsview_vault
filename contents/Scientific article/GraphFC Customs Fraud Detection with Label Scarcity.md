## Summary

The paper "GraphFC: Customs Fraud Detection with Label Scarcity" introduces a novel approach to detecting customs fraud using graph neural networks (GNNs) in a semi-supervised learning framework. The authors address the challenge of label scarcity in customs transactions, which are growing rapidly due to globalization. The proposed model, GraphFC, is designed to be model-agnostic and domain-specific, leveraging the inductive and semi-supervised capabilities of GNNs. Extensive experiments on real-world customs data from three different countries show that GraphFC outperforms existing baselines and state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving up to a 252% relative increase in recall. The paper highlights the importance of automating fraud detection to cope with the increasing volume of transactions and limited manpower for manual inspections.
