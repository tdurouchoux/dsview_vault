## Summary

The article explores techniques to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chunking augmentation techniques. The study focuses on three main areas: embedding models, chunk augmentation techniques, and reranking methodologies.

**Chunk Augmentation:**
- Chunking involves breaking down text into smaller, meaningful units to improve document retrieval.
- The study tests different chunking techniques, including baseline chunks, augmented baseline chunks (with additional metadata), chunks with keywords, and chunks with potential questions.
- Potential questions are generated using a prompt to create specific, detailed questions that a chunk can answer.

**Embedding Models:**
- Three embedding models are compared: E5 (Microsoft), BGE (BAAI), and Solon (Open source French model).
- E5 and BGE are multilingual models, while Solon is optimized for French text.

**Reranking:**
- Reranking involves using a cross-encoder model to reassess the similarity between query-document pairs and rearrange documents based on relevance.
- The study uses the crossencoder-electra-base-french-mmarcoFR model for reranking.

**Evaluation:**
- The performance of different chunking techniques and embedding models is evaluated using synthetic and human-generated questions.
- Results show that adding contextual information, such as keywords and potential questions, improves document retrieval accuracy.
- BGE embeddings outperformed E5 and Solon in most configurations.
- Reranking, particularly with BGE embeddings and augmented chunking, significantly enhances document retrieval accuracy.

**Conclusion:**
- The study highlights the importance of considering embedding models, chunking strategies, and reranking techniques to optimize LLM performance.
- Future research could explore additional chunking techniques, such as one-sentence chunking and selective chunking of potential questions, to further refine information retrieval accuracy.

- [E5-Large Embedding Model](https://huggingface.co/intfloat/multilingual-e5-large) : The E5-Large embedding model is a text embedding model developed by Microsoft that uses weakly-supervised contrastive pre-training to generate high-quality embeddings. The model is trained on a mixture of datasets and can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and text clustering by encoding input text into dense vector representations.
- [BGE-M3 Embedding Model](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) : The BGE-M3 model is a multilingual text embedding model developed by the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI). It supports over 100 languages and can handle long input sequences up to 8192 tokens. This makes it suitable for embedding multi-lingual and long-form text data.
- [Solon Embeddings Large 0.1](https://huggingface.co/OrdalieTech/Solon-embeddings-large-0.1) : The Solon model is a State-Of-The-Art Open source french embedding model. Data used in the paper being in French, we had to test it against robust multilingual models.
