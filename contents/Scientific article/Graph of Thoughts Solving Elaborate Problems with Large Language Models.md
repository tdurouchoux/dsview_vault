## Summary

The Graph of Thoughts (GoT) framework is introduced as a new paradigm for prompting large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks without requiring model updates. The key idea is to model the LLM reasoning process as an arbitrary graph, where thoughts are vertices and dependencies between thoughts are edges. This approach enables novel transformations of thoughts, such as aggregation, which allows for more complex and synergistic reasoning patterns. The framework is designed to be extensible, allowing for new thought transformations and the integration of different LLM models. The evaluation shows that GoT outperforms other prompting schemes, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT), in terms of both the quality of outcomes and cost efficiency. For example, GoT improves the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT while reducing costs by more than 31%. Additionally, GoT introduces a novel metric for evaluating prompting strategies, the volume of a thought, which measures the scope of information that a given LLM output could carry. The framework is demonstrated through various use cases, including sorting, set operations, keyword counting, and document merging, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness. The graph abstraction used in GoT is compared to other prompting schemes, highlighting its advantages in handling complex reasoning tasks. Overall, GoT represents a significant advancement in the field of prompt engineering, bringing LLM reasoning closer to human thinking mechanisms.
