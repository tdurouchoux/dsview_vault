## Summary

The content discusses the problem of time-series anomaly detection, which involves identifying unusual patterns or outliers in time-series data. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, including definitions, types of anomalies, and various methods for detection. It also covers the evaluation of these methods and the challenges associated with benchmarking and assessing their performance. The text highlights the importance of time-series analytics due to the increasing volume and velocity of streaming data, and it mentions the limitations of traditional statistical measures in this context. The document is structured into chapters, with the first chapter introducing the problem and its significance. It also discusses the challenges in defining anomalies and the need for robust methods to handle different types of time-series data, including univariate, multivariate, and streaming data. The content emphasizes the importance of accurate anomaly detection in various fields such as cybersecurity, financial markets, law enforcement, and healthcare. The document also mentions the need for a common benchmark to evaluate the performance of different anomaly detection methods.
