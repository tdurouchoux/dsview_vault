## Summary

The Gemini family of models, developed by Google, represents a significant advancement in multimodal model capabilities across text, code, image, audio, and video. The models are designed to support a wide range of applications, from complex reasoning tasks to on-device deployments. The family includes three main sizes: Ultra for highly complex tasks, Pro for enhanced performance and deployability at scale, and Nano for on-device applications. The models are trained jointly across image, audio, video, and text data to achieve strong generalist capabilities and cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain. Post-training is applied to improve overall quality, enhance target capabilities such as coding and multilingualism, and ensure alignment and safety criteria are met. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive suite of internal and external benchmarks covering a wide range of language, coding, reasoning, and multimodal tasks. Gemini Ultra, the most capable pre-trained model, sets new state-of-the-art results in 30 of 32 benchmarks, including 10 of 12 popular text and reasoning benchmarks, 9 of 9 image understanding benchmarks, 6 of 6 video understanding benchmarks, and 5 of 5 speech recognition and speech translation benchmarks. Notably, Gemini Ultra is the first model to achieve human-expert performance on the MMLU benchmark, scoring 90.04%. The models also demonstrate strong performance in multimodal reasoning tasks, such as the MMMU benchmark, which requires college-level subject knowledge and deliberate reasoning. The Gemini family is part of Google's mission to solve intelligence, advance science, and benefit humanity, and it is expected to enable new use cases and applications that have not yet been fully explored. Despite their impressive capabilities, the models have limitations, such as the need for ongoing research on "hallucinations" to ensure reliable and verifiable outputs, and struggles with high-level reasoning abilities like causal understanding, logical deduction, and counterfactual reasoning. The models are also subject to ethical considerations and risks, which are addressed through a structured approach to responsible deployment, including impact assessments, safety policies, mitigations, and evaluations. The Gemini family is a step towards developing a large-scale, modularized system with broad generalization capabilities across many modalities.
