## Summary

The paper introduces Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework designed to improve multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs). SRL reformulates problem-solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions," encouraging models to produce an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) dataset in a step-wise manner. This approach offers richer learning signals and promotes flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Additionally, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. The framework generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.
