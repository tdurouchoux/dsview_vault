## Summary

This manuscript provides a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of the field of (deep) reinforcement learning and sequential decision making. It covers various key topics, including:

- Value-based methods
- Policy-based methods
- Model-based methods
- Multi-agent RL
- Integration of LLMs and RL
- Other advanced topics such as offline RL, hierarchical RL, and intrinsic reward

The document is structured to give a big-picture view of the current state and trends in reinforcement learning.
