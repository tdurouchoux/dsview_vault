## Summary

This manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the field of (deep) reinforcement learning and sequential decision making. It covers several key topics, including:

1. **Value-based methods**: Techniques that estimate the value of actions or states to guide decision-making.
2. **Policy-based methods**: Approaches that directly optimize the policy that selects actions.
3. **Model-based methods**: Methods that build and use models of the environment to plan and make decisions.
4. **Multi-agent RL**: Reinforcement learning in environments with multiple interacting agents.
5. **LLMs and RL**: The intersection of large language models and reinforcement learning.
6. **Other topics**: Includes offline RL, hierarchical RL, and intrinsic reward mechanisms.

The paper aims to give a big-picture, up-to-date summary of these areas, making it a valuable resource for understanding the current state and trends in reinforcement learning.
