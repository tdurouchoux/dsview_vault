## Summary

The paper introduces a new concept of "sufficient context" to analyze Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, aiming to understand whether errors arise from insufficient context or the model's inability to utilize the context. The authors develop a method to classify instances based on whether the context provides enough information to answer the query, using an LLM-based autorater. Key findings include:

1. **Model Performance with Sufficient Context**: Larger models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT 4o, and Claude 3.5 excel when the context is sufficient but often output incorrect answers instead of abstaining when the context is insufficient. Smaller models like Mistral 3 and Gemma 2 hallucinate or abstain frequently, even with sufficient context.

2. **Hallucination vs. Abstention**: Models tend to hallucinate more than abstain, especially with insufficient context. The study categorizes cases where models provide correct answers despite insufficient context, highlighting the complexity of RAG systems.

3. **Selective Generation Method**: The authors propose a selective generation framework that uses sufficient context information to guide abstention, improving the fraction of correct answers by 2â€“10% for Gemini, GPT, and Gemma. This method leverages both confidence and sufficient context signals to reduce hallucinations.

4. **Fine-Tuning Limitations**: Fine-tuning open-source models with sufficient context information does not easily reduce the hallucination rate and may lead to higher abstention rates at the cost of fewer correct answers.

The paper concludes by discussing the limitations and future work, such as extending the definition of sufficient context to multi-modal RAG settings and developing a fine-grained sufficient context autorater. The study provides insights into the behavior of RAG systems and offers practical methods to improve their performance.
