## Summary

The paper introduces a new concept of "sufficient context" to analyze the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The authors develop a method to classify instances based on whether the context provides enough information to answer the query. They use this notion to analyze several models and datasets, finding that larger models with higher baseline performance excel with sufficient context but often output incorrect answers instead of abstaining when the context is insufficient. Smaller models, on the other hand, hallucinate or abstain frequently even with sufficient context.

The authors categorize cases where context is useful but not fully sufficient, and explore ways to reduce hallucinations in RAG systems. They introduce a selective generation method that leverages sufficient context information for guided abstention, improving the fraction of correct answers among times where the model responds by 2â€“10% for Gemini, GPT, and Gemma.

Key contributions include defining sufficient context, analyzing model performance with or without sufficient context, and developing a method to reduce hallucinations. The paper also discusses limitations and future work, such as extending the definition of sufficient context to multi-modal RAG settings and exploring how often different retrieval methods lead to sufficient context.
