## Summary

The paper introduces an LLM-based Semantic File System (LSFS) designed to enhance file management in AIOS by leveraging semantic information. LSFS enables users to interact with files through natural language prompts, improving usability and efficiency. Key features include semantic file retrieval, file update summarization, and semantic file rollback. The system incorporates a vector database for semantic indexing and supports various syscalls and APIs for file operations. Experiments show that LSFS achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and speed compared to traditional file systems. The paper also discusses the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of LSFS, highlighting its advantages in semantic file management tasks.
