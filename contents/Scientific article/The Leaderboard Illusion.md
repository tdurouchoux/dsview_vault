## Summary

The document discusses the challenges and issues with the Chatbot Arena, a platform for evaluating AI models. Key points include:

1. **Background and Importance**: Chatbot Arena is a significant platform for comparing generative AI models, influencing media, industry, and academia. It uses human preferences to evaluate models, which is considered more reliable than automated methods.

2. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **Private Testing and Selective Disclosure**: Some providers can test multiple private variants and only submit the best-performing one, leading to biased results.
   - **Data Access Asymmetries**: There are significant disparities in data access between proprietary and open-source providers, with proprietary models receiving more data.
   - **Overfitting Risk**: The potential for overfitting to Arena-specific dynamics rather than general model quality is a concern.
   - **Model Deprecation**: The deprecation policy can lead to unreliable rankings, especially for open-weight and open-source models.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - **Prohibit Score Retraction**: Ensure all tested variants' scores are permanently visible.
   - **Transparent Limits on Private Variants**: Enforce strict caps on private variants per provider.
   - **Clear Deprecation Criteria**: Establish transparent and auditable model deprecation criteria.
   - **Fair Sampling**: Implement fair sampling methods to ensure equal opportunities for all models.
   - **Transparency**: Provide public transparency into all tested models, deprecations, and sampling rates.

4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The study acknowledges limitations such as lack of access to raw data and the need for further investigation into adversarial voting and other evaluation challenges.

5. **Conclusion**: The document emphasizes the need for scientific integrity and fairness in AI progress, urging the community to demand better practices and transparency.
