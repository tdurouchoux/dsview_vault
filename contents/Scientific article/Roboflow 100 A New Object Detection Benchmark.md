## Summary

Roboflow 100 is a new object detection benchmark introduced in November 2022 and presented at CVPR in June 2023. It aims to advance the state-of-the-art in object recognition by providing a diverse set of datasets across various domains.

Key points:

- **Diverse Datasets**: Roboflow 100 consists of 100 separate datasets, spanning 7 imagery domains, with a total of 224,714 images and 829 class labels. It required 11,170 labeling hours.
- **Beyond Traditional Benchmarks**: Unlike traditional benchmarks like Microsoft COCO and Pascal VOC, which focus on a single dataset and metric, Roboflow 100 evaluates model generalization across diverse domains such as healthcare, aerial imagery, and video games.
- **Inspiration**: The benchmark was inspired by the research community's use of Roboflow datasets to test model generalizability in projects like Microsoft's Florence and GLIP.
- **Usage**: Details on how to use the benchmark can be found on the Roboflow 100 GitHub page.
- **Organizers and Sponsors**: The benchmark was organized by a team of researchers and is sponsored by Intel.

The Roboflow 100 benchmark provides a more comprehensive evaluation of object detection models' performance across a wide range of tasks and domains.
