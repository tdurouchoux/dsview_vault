## Summary

Roboflow 100 is a new object detection benchmark introduced in November 2022 and presented at CVPR in June 2023. It aims to advance object recognition by benchmarking computer vision models across diverse domains and task targets, moving beyond traditional benchmarks like Microsoft COCO and Pascal VOC.

Key features of Roboflow 100 include:
- 100 separate datasets spanning 7 imagery domains.
- 224,714 images with 829 class labels.
- Over 11,170 hours of labeling effort.
- Datasets derived from over 90,000 public datasets and 60 million public images on Roboflow.

The benchmark was inspired by the research community's use of Roboflow datasets to test model generalizability in projects like Microsoft's Florence and GLIP. Details on how to use the benchmark can be found on the Roboflow 100 GitHub page. The project is organized by a team of researchers and sponsored by Intel.
