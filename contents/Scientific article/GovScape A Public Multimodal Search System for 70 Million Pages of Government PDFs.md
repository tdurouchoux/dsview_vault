## Summary

GovScape is a public multimodal search system designed to enhance access and discoverability of government PDFs. It indexes 10 million federal government PDFs from the 2020 End of Term crawl, totaling 70 million pages. The system supports four primary search modes: metadata filtering, exact text search, semantic text search, and visual search. GovScape's architecture includes an embedding pipeline and open-source codebase, with a pre-processing cost of approximately $1,500, demonstrating scalability. The system is available at a specified URL, and the authors outline plans to scale to 100+ million PDFs.
