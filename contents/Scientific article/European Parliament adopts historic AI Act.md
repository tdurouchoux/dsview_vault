## Summary

The European Parliament has adopted the AI Act, a comprehensive regulation aimed at managing the risks and fostering innovation in artificial intelligence. Key points include:

- **Risk-Based Approach**: The regulation categorizes AI systems based on risk, with stricter requirements for higher-risk systems.
- **Bans and Restrictions**: Outright bans on certain AI uses, such as predictive policing and systems that infer sensitive personal attributes from biometric data. Real-time facial recognition in public spaces is also banned, with exceptions for law enforcement under judicial approval.
- **Compliance Timeline**: AI models like ChatGPT will have a 12-month compliance period, while other provisions must be met within two years.
- **Fines and Penalties**: Violations can result in fines ranging from €7.5 million to €35 million, depending on the infringement and company size.
- **Lobbying Influence**: The legislation faced significant lobbying from tech giants and AI startups, with watchdogs warning of potential weakening of the rules.
- **Future-Proofing**: The EU aims to balance innovation with protection, setting a global standard for trustworthy AI.

The AI Act is expected to be endorsed by the EU's 27 states in April and published in the EU's Official Journal in May or June.
