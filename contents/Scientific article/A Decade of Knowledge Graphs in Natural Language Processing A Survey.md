## Summary

The survey "A Decade of Knowledge Graphs in Natural Language Processing" analyzes 507 papers to provide a comprehensive overview of the role of knowledge graphs (KGs) in natural language processing (NLP). The authors categorize research topics, review the maturity of various research streams, and present a taxonomy of tasks. Key findings include the rapid adoption and spread of KGs in NLP, with a structured overview of the research landscape and directions for future work. The survey was accepted to AACL-IJCNLP 2022.
