## Summary

The paper "A Decade of Knowledge Graphs in Natural Language Processing: A Survey" provides a comprehensive review of the role of knowledge graphs (KGs) in natural language processing (NLP) over the past decade. The authors systematically analyzed 507 papers to categorize established topics and assess the maturity of individual research streams. The survey offers a structured overview of the research landscape, a taxonomy of tasks, and summarizes key findings. It also highlights directions for future work in the intersection of KGs and NLP. The paper is accepted to AACL-IJCNLP 2022 and covers topics in computation and language, as well as artificial intelligence.
