## Summary

The article discusses the transformative impact of large language models (LLMs) on the field of natural language processing (NLP). Key points include:

1. **Historical Context**: NLP, dating back to the 1940s, aimed to make human language tractable for computers. The introduction of transformer models in 2017, particularly BERT and GPT, revolutionized the field.

2. **Initial Reactions**: The transformer model was initially met with skepticism, but its success led to a flurry of research and benchmarking, known as "BERTology."

3. **GPT-3 and Industry Impact**: The release of GPT-3 in 2020 marked a significant shift, causing many researchers to question the future of their work. The model's capabilities led to a career-existential crisis for some academics.

4. **Controversies and Debates**: The field was divided between those who believed in the potential of LLMs and those who were skeptical. The "understanding wars" and the paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots" highlighted these divisions.

5. **ChatGPT's Release**: The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 had a profound impact, making many research problems obsolete and causing a crisis among Ph.D. students. The field faced intense global attention and media scrutiny.

6. **Post-ChatGPT Era**: The field adapted to the new reality, with some researchers focusing on studying LLMs and others pivoting to industry roles. The boundaries between NLP and AI became increasingly blurred.

7. **Future Perspectives**: Opinions vary on whether LLMs represent a paradigm shift. Some see it as a significant change, while others view it as an evolution of existing principles.

The article concludes with reflections on the future of NLP and AI, highlighting the ongoing debates and the need for rigorous scientific inquiry.
