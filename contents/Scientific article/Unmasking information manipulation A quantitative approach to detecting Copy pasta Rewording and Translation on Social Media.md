## Summary

This study introduces a methodology called the "3âˆ†-space duplicate methodology" to detect three types of information manipulation techniques on social media: Copy-Pasta, Rewording, and Translation. The approach quantifies semantic, grapheme, and language aspects of messages to identify abnormally close messages likely part of a coordinated campaign. The methodology was validated using a synthetic dataset generated with ChatGPT and DeepL, and applied to a real-world dataset on Venezuelan actors from Twitter Transparency. The study successfully identified all three types of inauthentic duplicates in the synthetic dataset and uncovered inauthentic duplicates across political, commercial, and entertainment contexts in the Twitter dataset. The distinct focus on clustered alterations to messages makes the approach efficient and effective at detecting large-scale instances of textual manipulation, including AI-generated ones. Moreover, the method offers a robust tool for identifying translated content, overlooked in previous research. The study also represents the first comprehensive analysis of copy-pasta detection, providing a reliable technique for tracking duplicate textual content across social networks.
