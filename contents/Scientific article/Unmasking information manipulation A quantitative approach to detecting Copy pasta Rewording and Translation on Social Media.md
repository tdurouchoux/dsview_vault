## Summary

This study introduces a methodology called "3âˆ†-space duplicate methodology" to detect three types of information manipulation techniques on social media: Copy-Pasta, Rewording, and Translation. The approach quantifies semantic, grapheme, and language aspects of messages to identify abnormally close messages likely part of a coordinated campaign. The method was validated using a synthetic dataset generated with ChatGPT and DeepL, and applied to a real-world dataset on Venezuelan actors from Twitter Transparency. The study successfully identified all three types of inauthentic duplicates in the synthetic dataset and uncovered inauthentic duplicates across political, commercial, and entertainment contexts in the Twitter dataset. The methodology offers a robust tool for identifying translated content and detecting large-scale instances of textual manipulation, including AI-generated ones. The distinct focus on clustered alterations to messages makes the approach efficient and effective. The research also represents the first comprehensive analysis of copy-pasta detection, providing a reliable technique for tracking duplicate textual content across social networks.
