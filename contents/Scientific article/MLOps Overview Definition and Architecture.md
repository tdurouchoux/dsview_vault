## Summary

The paper discusses the challenges in bringing machine learning (ML) projects into production and introduces the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to address these issues. MLOps aims to automate and operationalize ML products, drawing from DevOps principles. The authors conducted a mixed-method research, including a literature review, tool review, and expert interviews, to identify key principles, components, roles, and architectures necessary for MLOps. They define MLOps as a paradigm that combines best practices, concepts, and development culture to facilitate the end-to-end conceptualization, implementation, monitoring, deployment, and scalability of ML products. The paper highlights open challenges in adopting MLOps, categorized into organizational, ML system, and operational challenges. The authors hope to provide clear guidelines for professionals and researchers to improve the success rate of ML projects in production.
