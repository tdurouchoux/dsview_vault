## Summary

The paper discusses the challenges in bringing machine learning (ML) projects into production and introduces the concept of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) to address these issues. MLOps aims to automate and operationalize ML products, drawing from principles of DevOps, which emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation in software development.

The authors conducted a mixed-method research, including a literature review, tool review, and expert interviews, to identify key principles, components, and roles necessary for MLOps. They propose a definition of MLOps as a paradigm that includes best practices, sets of concepts, and a development culture for the end-to-end conceptualization, implementation, monitoring, deployment, and scalability of ML products. The paper also highlights open challenges in adopting MLOps, categorized into organizational, ML system, and operational challenges.

Key principles of MLOps include CI/CD automation, workflow orchestration, reproducibility, versioning, collaboration, continuous ML training and evaluation, ML metadata tracking/logging, continuous monitoring, and feedback loops. The authors identify technical components that implement these principles, such as CI/CD components, source code repositories, workflow orchestration components, feature store systems, model training infrastructure, model registries, ML metadata stores, model serving components, and monitoring components.

The paper also outlines necessary roles for successful MLOps implementation, including business stakeholders, solution architects, data scientists, data engineers, software engineers, DevOps engineers, and ML engineers/MLOps engineers. The authors present a generalized MLOps end-to-end architecture and workflow, providing guidance for ML researchers and practitioners.

In conclusion, the paper aims to support a common understanding of MLOps and its associated concepts, assisting researchers and professionals in setting up successful ML projects. The authors hope to facilitate more robust predictions in real-world environments by addressing the challenges in automating and operating ML systems.
