## Summary

InstructPipe is a research prototype that automates the creation of AI pipelines in visual programming environments using human instructions and large language models (LLMs). It consists of three main modules: a Node Selector, a Code Writer, and a Code Interpreter. The Node Selector identifies potential nodes for a pipeline based on user instructions, the Code Writer generates pseudocode for the pipeline, and the Code Interpreter renders the pipeline in a visual editor. The system uses a two-stage LLM refinement strategy and represents pipelines as pseudocode for efficiency. Technical and user evaluations show that InstructPipe significantly reduces user interactions and workload, making it easier for users to prototype ML pipelines. The research highlights the potential of human-AI collaboration in visual programming and opens up discussions on integrating LLMs into such environments.
