## Summary

The report outlines Google's approach to responsible AI, structured around the NIST AI Risk Management Framework: Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage.

**Govern:**
- Google's AI Principles guide decision-making and inform frameworks like the Secure AI Framework and Frontier Safety Framework.
- Pre- and post-launch processes ensure alignment with principles and policies, focusing on safety, privacy, and security.
- Transparency is promoted through model cards and data lineage tracking.

**Map:**
- Google conducts extensive research to identify and understand AI risks, publishing over 300 papers on responsible AI topics.
- External domain expertise is leveraged to complement in-house work.
- A risk taxonomy is developed to codify and understand potential risks associated with AI.

**Measure:**
- Multi-layered red teaming, both internal and external, proactively tests AI systems for weaknesses.
- Model and application evaluations assess alignment with frameworks and policies.
- AI-assisted evaluations help scale risk measurement, using AI autoraters and synthetic testing data.

**Manage:**
- Mitigations for content safety, security, and privacy are implemented, including safety filters, system instructions, and safety tuning.
- Phased launches and post-launch monitoring ensure continuous improvement and risk management.
- User understanding is advanced through provenance technology, explainability guidelines, and AI literacy education.
- The broader ecosystem is supported with research funding, tools, and standards.

The report concludes with a commitment to continuous improvement and collaboration to ensure AI is developed and used responsibly, benefiting society and upholding core values.
