## Summary

The document is a progress report on Responsible AI by Google, published in February 2025. It outlines Google's methods for governing, mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks, aligned with the NIST framework. Key points include:

1. **Governance**: Google's AI Principles guide their approach, with a focus on bold innovation, responsible development, and collaborative partnership. They have developed frameworks like the Secure AI Framework and the Frontier Safety Framework to address security, privacy, and safety concerns.

2. **Mapping Risks**: Google conducts extensive research to identify and understand AI risks, publishing over 300 papers on responsible AI topics. They collaborate with external experts and institutions to augment their understanding of emerging risks.

3. **Measuring Risks**: Google employs multi-layered red teaming, both internally and externally, to proactively test AI systems for weaknesses. They also use model and application evaluations to assess alignment with established frameworks and policies.

4. **Managing Risks**: Google implements various mitigations to manage content safety, privacy, and security. They use techniques like safety filters, system instructions, and safety tuning. They also employ phased launches and post-launch monitoring to ensure continuous improvement and risk management.

5. **Ecosystem Enablement**: Google supports the broader ecosystem by providing research funding, tools for developers and users, and promoting industry collaboration on the development of standards and best practices.

6. **Transparency and Accountability**: Google regularly publishes external model cards and technical reports to provide transparency into model creation, function, and intended use. They also invest in tooling for model and data lineage to promote transparency and accountability.

7. **User Understanding**: Google works to advance user understanding of AI through innovative developments in provenance technology, research-backed explainability guidelines, and AI literacy education.

The report concludes with a commitment to continue investing in research, collaborating with external experts and institutions, and engaging with the wider community to inform how AI is developed and used responsibly.
