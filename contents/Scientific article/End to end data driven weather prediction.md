## Summary

The article presents Aardvark Weather, an end-to-end data-driven weather prediction system that replaces traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) pipelines. Key points include:

1. **System Overview**: Aardvark Weather consists of three modules:
   - **Encoder**: Estimates the initial atmospheric state from raw observations.
   - **Processor**: Produces forecasts at subsequent lead times.
   - **Decoder**: Generates local predictions from global forecasts.

2. **Data Sources**: The system uses a variety of observational data, including remote sensing instruments and in situ observations, but relies solely on observations without NWP products at deployment time.

3. **Performance**: Aardvark Weather outperforms operational NWP baselines for several variables and lead times. It provides skilful forecasts for up to ten days, competing with post-processed global NWP baselines and state-of-the-art end-to-end forecasting systems.

4. **End-to-End Tuning**: The system can be fine-tuned to optimize performance for specific variables and regions, demonstrating improvements in accuracy.

5. **Advantages**: Aardvark Weather is faster, computationally cheaper, and easier to improve and maintain compared to conventional NWP systems. It has the potential to enable the creation of customized models for various end users.

6. **Future Directions**: The article suggests further capabilities, such as extending Aardvark to support additional forecast variables, supporting different types of end-user forecasts, and using end-to-end systems at longer lead times for seasonal forecast products.

7. **Limitations and Considerations**: The current model does not yet run at the resolution of IFS, and further studies are required to increase grid resolution and produce forecast ensembles. Additional observational modalities and dealing with observation drift are also considered.

The article concludes by envisioning Aardvark Weather as a pioneer for a new generation of end-to-end weather forecasting systems, with significant potential for real-world impact.
