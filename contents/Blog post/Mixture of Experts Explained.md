## Summary

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are designed to be pretrained faster and offer faster inference compared to dense models, but they require high VRAM and face challenges in fine-tuning. MoEs replace dense feed-forward network (FFN) layers with MoE layers, which consist of multiple experts and a gate network that routes tokens to these experts. The history of MoEs dates back to 1991, with significant advancements in the 2010s leading to their application in NLP.

Sparsity in MoEs allows for conditional computation, where only parts of the network are active for specific inputs, enabling efficient scaling. Load balancing is crucial to ensure all experts are utilized equally. MoEs integrated with transformers, such as in the GShard and Switch Transformers models, have shown promising results in large-scale training. Switch Transformers, in particular, introduced a simplified single-expert strategy and explored expert capacity and auxiliary loss for load balancing.

Fine-tuning MoEs presents unique challenges, including overfitting and the need for different hyperparameter setups. Recent work suggests that MoEs benefit significantly from instruction tuning. The choice between sparse MoEs and dense models depends on the specific use case, with MoEs being more suitable for high-throughput scenarios and dense models for low-throughput, low-VRAM scenarios.

Efficient training and serving techniques for MoEs include expert parallelism, capacity factor adjustments, and distillation methods. Open-source projects and resources are available for training and experimenting with MoEs. Future directions include distilling MoEs to dense models, exploring model merging techniques, and performing extreme quantization techniques.
