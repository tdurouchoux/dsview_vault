## Summary

The post discusses the evolution and importance of feature platforms in the MLOps stack, which handle feature engineering, computation, and serving for machine learning models. It highlights the benefits of feature platforms, such as reduced engineering time and improved performance, as seen in companies like LinkedIn.

The post is divided into two parts. The first part explains the evolution of feature platforms, differentiating them from feature stores and model platforms. It also discusses the types of features (batch, real-time, near real-time) that a feature platform can compute and their respective pros and cons.

The second part focuses on the challenges of making feature platforms self-serve for data scientists, particularly the slow iteration speed for streaming features. It explores the need for data scientist-friendly APIs (Scala, SQL, Python) and functionalities for fast experimentation, such as data discoverability, governance, and automated backfills.

The post concludes by emphasizing the importance of speed in feature platforms and the significant investment required to build them. It also acknowledges the learning curve and trial-and-error process involved in developing a feature platform.

Key takeaways include the distinction between feature platforms and other systems, the types of features they can handle, and the challenges in making them self-serve for data scientists. The post also provides a comparison of feature platforms used by various companies and references to further reading.
