https://hex.tech/blog/myth-of-data-team-roi/
## Summary

The article discusses the challenges of measuring the ROI of data teams and argues that it's not a quantifiable metric. Key points include:

1. **Difficulty in Measurement**: Quantifying the impact of data work, especially infrastructure investments, is complex and often leads to "measurement theater" with underwhelming results.

2. **Alternative Approach**: Instead of self-measurement, the author suggests using Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a proxy for ROI. The value of a data team should be judged by the satisfaction and advocacy of its stakeholders.

3. **Service and Agency**: Data teams should embrace their role as a service organization, supporting other teams' success. They must also drive agency to ensure their insights inspire action.

4. **Future Impact**: To gain budget and support, data teams should focus on making their impact clear to stakeholders, rather than relying on spreadsheets to tell their story.

The article concludes that data teams should aim to make their impact so obvious that stakeholders advocate for them, negating the need for ROI justification.
