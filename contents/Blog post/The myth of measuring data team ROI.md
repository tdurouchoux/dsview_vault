## Summary

The article discusses the challenges of measuring the ROI of data teams. Key points include:

- Measuring data team ROI quantitatively is difficult and often leads to "measurement theater."
- Instead of self-reporting, the value of a data team should be communicated through stakeholders' advocacy, similar to a Net Promoter Score (NPS).
- Data teams should embrace their role as a service organization, supporting other functions to make better decisions.
- The real ROI of data insights is realized when they inspire action.
- Data teams should focus on making their impact obvious to stakeholders to gain budget and support.
- The article concludes that data teams should aim to have stakeholders advocate for their value, rather than trying to quantify it themselves.
