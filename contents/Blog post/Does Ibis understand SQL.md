## Summary

Ibis is a data analysis tool that provides a dataframe API for working with databases, supporting multiple backends like ClickHouse, Apache Flink, and Starburst Galaxy. It doesn't inherently understand SQL but translates user queries into SQLGlot expressions for execution. The process involves building an expression, compiling it, and executing the compiled expression on the chosen backend. Ibis can handle SQL strings through methods like Table.sql() and Backend.sql(), but it only understands the output schema, not the inner structure of the SQL. The library is designed to be composable and works with various data ecosystems, offering capabilities similar to those of SQL comprehension tools.
