## Summary

GitHub Spark is now in public preview for Copilot Pro+ subscribers. It enables users to build and deploy full-stack intelligent apps using natural language, with no setup required. Key features include:

- **Natural language to app**: Describe your idea and Spark builds it, including frontend and backend capabilities powered by Claude Sonnet 4.
- **No setup required**: Includes data, LLM inference, hosting, deployments, and GitHub auth out-of-the-box.
- **Add AI to your apps**: Integrate intelligent features powered by various LLMs without managing API keys.
- **One-click deployments**: Publish your app with a single click.
- **Build your way**: Use natural language, visual editing, or code with GitHub Copilot completions.
- **Create a repository**: Get a repository with GitHub Actions and Dependabot incorporated.
- **Expand with Copilot agents**: Iterate with Copilot agent mode or assign issues to Copilot coding agent.

Spark is available for Copilot Pro+ users, with rollout to additional customers coming soon. Users can visit github.com/spark to build their first app or sign up for a Pro+ account to access Spark. The UI for features in public preview is subject to change.
