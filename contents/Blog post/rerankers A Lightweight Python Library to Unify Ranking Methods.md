## Summary

The blog post introduces rerankers, a lightweight Python library designed to unify various re-ranking methods used in information retrieval pipelines. The library aims to simplify the process of implementing and switching between different re-ranking approaches, which are often complex and scattered across different codebases.

Key points include:

1. **Two-Stage Pipelines**: These are popular because they balance performance and efficiency. The first stage retrieves a set of candidate documents using a lightweight method, while the second stage re-ranks these documents using a more accurate but computationally expensive model.

2. **Diverse Re-ranking Methods**: There are several approaches to re-ranking, including cross-encoder models, MonoT5, late-interaction models, and listwise methods. Each has its own advantages and use cases, but integrating them can be challenging due to different input/output formats and dependencies.

3. **Rerankers Library**: The library provides a unified interface for common re-ranking methods, making it easy to switch between them with minimal code changes. It is designed to be lightweight, modular, and extensible, with support for various model types and easy integration of new methods.

4. **Key Classes**: The library primarily uses two classes, `Reranker` and `RankedResults`. The `Reranker` class loads and applies re-ranking models, while `RankedResults` stores and manages the re-ranked documents and their associated metadata.

5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Rerankers is designed to complement existing retrieval frameworks and aims to preserve the performance of the methods it implements. It is open-source and available on GitHub.

The post concludes with key takeaways, emphasizing the benefits of two-stage pipelines, the variety of re-ranking methods, and the ease of use and extensibility provided by the rerankers library.
