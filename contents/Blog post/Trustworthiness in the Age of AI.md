## Summary

The text discusses the evolution of trust in computing, from traditional calculators to AI systems. Key points include:

1. **Traditional Computing**: Computers are reliable calculators, providing consistent results for well-defined tasks.
2. **Big Data and Algorithms**: With probabilistic and error-prone tasks, trust shifts from the computer to the algorithm's creators and the quality of data.
3. **AI and LLMs**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT present new challenges. They are not infallible calculators but are fallible, noisy, and exhibit emergent behavior. They demand trust directly, unlike traditional tools that proxy trust to their creators.
4. **Trust Models**: The author argues that AI requires a new model of trust, acknowledging its potential to deceive and its inconcrete reasoning.
5. **Responsibility of Engineers**: Engineers building AI systems must understand their limitations, evaluate them rigorously, and ensure they are used appropriately. They should ask critical questions about the reliability, purpose, and potential impact of the AI they create.
6. **Current Challenges**: The rapid deployment of AI applications outpaces our ability to evaluate and correct them, leading to a collapse in the traditional trust model between computers, engineers, businesses, and users.

The author emphasizes the need for engineers to be trustworthy and to recognize that AI, despite its convincing nature, is a tool that requires careful and responsible use.
