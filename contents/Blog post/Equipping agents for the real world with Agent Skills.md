## Summary

Anthropic introduces Agent Skills, a method to equip agents with domain-specific expertise using organized folders of instructions, scripts, and resources. These skills are designed to transform general-purpose agents like Claude into specialized ones, making them more adaptable and efficient in real-world tasks.

Key points:

1. **Agent Skills Structure**: A skill is a directory containing a SKILL.md file with YAML frontmatter (name and description) and optional additional files for progressive disclosure of information. This structure allows agents to load information only as needed, making skills flexible and scalable.

2. **Functionality**: Skills can include code for agents to execute as tools, enabling deterministic and efficient operations. For example, a PDF skill can include a Python script to extract form fields from a PDF.

3. **Development and Evaluation**: Best practices for creating and testing skills include starting with evaluation, structuring for scale, thinking from the agent's perspective, and iterating with the agent. Security considerations involve auditing skills from less-trusted sources and paying attention to potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Future of Skills**: Anthropic plans to add features supporting the full lifecycle of creating, editing, discovering, sharing, and using skills. They also aim to enable agents to create, edit, and evaluate skills independently.

5. **Availability**: Agent Skills are currently supported across Claude.ai, Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, and the Claude Developer Platform. Users can get started by checking out the Skills docs and cookbook.

The article concludes with acknowledgments to the team behind Agent Skills and invites users to sign up for the developer newsletter for updates and resources.
