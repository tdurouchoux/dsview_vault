## Summary

Google has released an experimental Gemini Embedding text model (gemini-embedding-exp-03-07) via the Gemini API. This model, trained on the Gemini model, surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model (text-embedding-004) and achieves the top rank on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) Multilingual leaderboard with a mean score of 68.32. Key features include:

- **General Applicability**: Works effectively out-of-the-box across diverse domains like finance, science, legal, and search.
- **Improved Capabilities**: Longer input token length, higher output dimensions (3K), and Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) for scalable storage.
- **Expanded Language Support**: Over 100 languages supported.
- **Unified Model**: Surpasses previous task-specific models.

The model is accessible via the Gemini API and is currently in an experimental phase with limited capacity. Feedback is welcomed as Google works towards a stable, generally available release.
