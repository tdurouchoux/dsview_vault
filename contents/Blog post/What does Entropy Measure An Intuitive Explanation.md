## Summary

Entropy, in the context of information theory, measures the uncertainty or unpredictability of a set of data. It quantifies the amount of information or surprise in a dataset. Higher entropy indicates greater uncertainty, while lower entropy suggests more predictability. It's often used in data science for tasks like feature selection, clustering, and decision tree algorithms. The formula for entropy is derived from probability theory, and it's a fundamental concept in understanding and analyzing data.
