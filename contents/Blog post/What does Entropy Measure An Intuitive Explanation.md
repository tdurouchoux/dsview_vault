## Summary

Entropy, in the context of information theory, measures the uncertainty or unpredictability of a random variable. It quantifies the expected amount of information produced by a stochastic source of data. The higher the entropy, the more uncertain the outcome, and vice versa. For a discrete random variable X with possible outcomes {x1, ..., xn}, entropy H(X) is calculated as:

H(X) = - âˆ‘ P(xi) * log2(P(xi))

where P(xi) is the probability of each outcome. Key points include:

1. Entropy is zero when the outcome is certain (P(xi) = 1 for one outcome, 0 for others).
2. Entropy is maximized when all outcomes are equally likely, indicating maximum uncertainty.
3. Entropy is a non-negative quantity, with units in bits if using base-2 logarithm.
4. It is widely used in data compression, machine learning, and other fields to measure information content and uncertainty.
