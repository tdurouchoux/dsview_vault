## Summary

The article discusses best practices for choosing and customizing fonts in data visualizations, emphasizing readability and accessibility. Key points include:

1. **Font Choice**:
   - Prefer sans-serif fonts for data visualizations as they are cleaner and easier to skim, especially for numbers.
   - Use serif fonts sparingly, often for titles, to convey a more traditional or professional look.
   - Ensure the font includes all necessary symbols and characters, such as currency signs, math symbols, and special characters.

2. **Font Style**:
   - Use lining and tabular numbers for better alignment and readability in tables and charts.
   - Avoid very thin fonts as they are hard to read; use bold fonts only for emphasis.
   - Avoid overly narrow or wide fonts, as they can be difficult to read or use too much space.

3. **Font Adjustments**:
   - Ensure text is big enough to read, with a recommended minimum size of 12px.
   - Use high-contrast colors for text to meet accessibility standards.
   - Use uppercase text sparingly and adjust letter spacing and font size to maintain readability.

4. **Examples**:
   - The article provides examples from various publications like The Economist, Bloomberg, and The Guardian, showcasing different font choices and styles.
   - It also mentions specific fonts like Roboto, Lato, and Source Sans Pro, which are good options for data visualizations.
