## Summary

The article discusses the development and impact of Splink, an open-source Python package for data linking and deduplication, created by a team at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The author, Robin Linacre, highlights the challenges of data linking, such as variations in records and computational intensity, and the benefits of solving these issues, including improved data quality and richer datasets.

Linacre contrasts historical, siloed approaches to data linking with the collaborative, open-source development of Splink. Key features of Splink include speed, accuracy, scalability, and compatibility with various IT systems. The software has been successfully used by the MoJ and other organizations, leading to significant time and cost savings.

The success of Splink is attributed to its open-source nature, which facilitates global collaboration, continuous improvement, and widespread adoption. Linacre advocates for more open-source projects in government to break down silos and drive innovation. The article concludes with acknowledgments to ADR UK and the Splink community.
