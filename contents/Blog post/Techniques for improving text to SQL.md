## Summary

The blog post discusses advancements in text-to-SQL technology, focusing on Google Cloud's techniques to improve the accuracy and usability of generating SQL queries from natural language. Key points include:

1. **Challenges in Text-to-SQL**:
   - **Business-Specific Context**: LLMs need context about database schemas, relevant columns, and business semantics to generate accurate SQL.
   - **User Intent**: Natural language is ambiguous, and LLMs may hallucinate answers. Understanding user intent and providing follow-up questions is crucial.
   - **SQL Dialects**: Different SQL dialects have subtle differences, and LLMs need to adhere to these specifics.

2. **Techniques for Improvement**:
   - **SQL-Aware Models**: Using strong LLMs like Gemini, with custom fine-tuning for specific SQL dialects.
   - **Disambiguation**: Using LLMs to identify unclear questions and generate follow-up questions to clarify user intent.
   - **Retrieval and In-Context Learning**: Providing models with relevant context, including schema annotations, examples of similar SQL, and recent queries.
   - **Validation and Reprompting**: Using non-AI approaches like query parsing and dry runs to validate generated SQL and reprompt the model if necessary.
   - **Self-Consistency**: Generating multiple queries for the same user question and selecting the best one to improve accuracy.

3. **Evaluation and Measurement**:
   - **Benchmarks**: Using academic benchmarks like BIRD-bench and developing synthetic benchmarks to cover a broad range of SQL engines and features.
   - **Metrics**: Combining user metrics and offline evaluation metrics, employing both human and automated evaluation, including LLM-as-a-judge techniques.
   - **Continuous Evaluation**: Using evaluations to quickly test new models, prompting techniques, and other improvements.

The post concludes by encouraging readers to try Gemini text-to-SQL in various Google Cloud products and stay tuned for more deep dives into text-to-SQL solutions.
