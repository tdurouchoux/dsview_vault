## Summary

The author created an automated AI research paper newsletter system to streamline paper discovery. The system:

1. Monitors arXiv RSS feeds for new AI papers.
2. Uses Claude to evaluate relevance based on specified interests (e.g., practical AI implementation, regulation, LLM applications).
3. Generates summaries of key findings and practical implications for relevant papers.
4. Delivers curated papers via email twice weekly.

The system runs on AWS using Lambda, Claude, SES, DynamoDB, S3, Cloudwatch, and SNS. It is open-source and adaptable, with the code available on GitHub. The newsletter includes featured papers with detailed summaries, additional papers of interest, and an overview of emerging trends. The author shares the project to demonstrate how LLMs can be used for content analysis and curation, and welcomes contributions and feedback.
