## Summary

The author created an automated AI research paper newsletter system to streamline the discovery of relevant AI research papers. The system is fully automated and runs on AWS, using Lambda functions, Claude for content analysis, SES for email delivery, DynamoDB for subscriber management, and S3 for email storage. The system monitors arXiv RSS feeds for new AI papers, uses Claude to evaluate their relevance to the author's interests, generates summaries focused on key findings and practical implications, and delivers curated papers via email twice weekly. The newsletter includes featured papers with detailed summaries and links to the full paper, additional papers of interest, and an overview of emerging trends across the selected papers. The author has made the code available on GitHub for anyone interested in creating their own version. The project demonstrates how tools like Claude can be leveraged to streamline information discovery and processing.
