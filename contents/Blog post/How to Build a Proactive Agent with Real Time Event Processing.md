## Summary

The article discusses the creation of proactive agents using real-time event processing and large language models (LLMs). Key points include:

- **Proactive Agents**: Agents that can act autonomously based on real-time events, such as sending emails, adjusting home settings, or managing stocks without explicit user commands.
- **Challenges**: LLMs are not efficient for processing every single event due to high costs and latency. Instead, they should create event listeners to trigger actions when specific events occur.
- **Architecture**: The proposed architecture involves a streaming database that stores, processes, and transforms events. The LLM sets up rules in the streaming database to filter and respond to relevant events.
- **SQL Interface**: The use of SQL simplifies the process of defining event filters and transformations, reducing the need for complex prompt engineering and domain-specific knowledge.
- **Streaming Databases**: These databases are essential for real-time event processing, offering stream processing engines, data storage, and SQL interfaces. RisingWave is highlighted as a suitable choice.
- **Streaming Joins**: The article demonstrates the capability of streaming databases to handle complex joins, which are common in event-driven applications.
- **Demo**: A demo is provided to illustrate how LLMs can leverage streaming databases for real-time event monitoring.

The article emphasizes the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using streaming databases with LLMs to create proactive agents that can respond to real-time events autonomously.
