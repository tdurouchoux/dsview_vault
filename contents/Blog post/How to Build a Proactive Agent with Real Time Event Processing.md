## Summary

The article discusses building proactive agents using real-time event processing and large language models (LLMs). Key points include:

- **Proactive Agents**: Agents that can act autonomously based on real-time events, such as sending emails, controlling home devices, or managing stocks without explicit user commands.
- **Architecture**: The proposed architecture involves a streaming database that ingests, processes, and transforms events. The LLM sets up event listeners to monitor specific events and takes action when triggered.
- **Streaming Database**: Essential for real-time event processing, offering stream processing, data storage, and SQL interface. RisingWave is highlighted as a suitable choice.
- **SQL Interface**: Simplifies event filtering and LLM invocation by describing desired results rather than writing complex computation procedures.
- **Streaming Joins**: Demonstrates the capability to handle complex real-time data joins, crucial for event-driven applications.
- **Demo**: A practical demo is provided to illustrate how LLMs can leverage streaming databases for event monitoring.

The article emphasizes the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of using streaming databases with LLMs for proactive, event-driven actions.
