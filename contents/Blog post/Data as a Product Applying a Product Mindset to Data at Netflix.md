## Summary

The Netflix Technology Blog post "Data as a Product: Applying a Product Mindset to Data at Netflix" advocates for treating data with the same care and intentionality as a consumer-facing product. Key points include:

- **Data as a Product**: Data should be intentionally designed, built, maintained, and measured to create value, with clear purpose, defined audience, and continuous evaluation.
- **Benefits**: Applying product management principles to data clarifies purpose, encourages thoughtful design, enforces quality standards, and ensures lifecycle management.
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Clear Purpose**: Data products should solve a specific problem or enable a business use case.
  - **Defined Users**: Identify and understand the needs of data users to shape design.
  - **Measurable Value and Quality**: Focus on data health, trustworthiness, and long-term innovation.
  - **Thoughtful Design and Documentation**: Ensure data is well-structured, intuitive, and easy to access.
  - **Lifecycle Management**: Evaluate and maintain data products throughout their lifecycle, including eventual retirement.
  - **Clear Ownership**: Assign responsibility for data product accuracy, availability, and usability.
  - **Trust and Reliability**: Ensure data products are dependable and transparent to earn user trust.

By adopting this framework, Netflix aims to elevate data to a first-class entity, ensuring it is valuable, trusted, and aligned with strategic goals.
