## Summary

DocWrangler is an interactive IDE designed to streamline the process of building and refining LLM-powered data processing pipelines. It addresses the challenges of iterative refinement and exploratory data analysis, offering features like a spreadsheet interface with automatic summary overlays, in-situ fine-grained feedback, and an AI assistant for intelligent prompt refinement. Key tips for effective use include starting with data inspection, open-ended exploration, iterative refinement, and handling complexity with optimization. Future developments may include richer visualizations, enhanced validation support, and more interactive optimization capabilities. DocWrangler is part of a broader mission to make LLM-powered data processing more accessible and effective.
