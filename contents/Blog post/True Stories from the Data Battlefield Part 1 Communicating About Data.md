## Summary

The blog post discusses common non-technical challenges faced by data professionals when communicating about data with organizational stakeholders. It presents four case studies, each illustrating a different communication issue, its diagnosis, and potential solutions.

1. **The Graph Was Too Complicated**: A data scientist presented a complex graph to top management, which led to disengagement. The solution is to create simple, clear graphs with explicit takeaways.

2. **The Graph Was Too Simple**: A simple graph led to requests for endless additional data, derailing the project. Solutions include recentering the discussion on high-level topics or considering a change in organization if data is consistently ignored.

3. **When A Graph Leads to Stakeholder Tunnel Vision**: A manager fixated on an irrelevant data point, derailing the meeting. The solution is to recenter the discussion on the main topic.

4. **When the Data Reveal an Uncomfortable Truth**: Presenting data that revealed an uncomfortable truth led to a negative reaction. The solution is to seek a more professional organization if such behavior is common.

The post concludes by emphasizing the importance of discussing and addressing these common communication issues in data projects. The next blog post will focus on interpersonal issues in data projects. The post also includes R code used to produce the graphs discussed.
