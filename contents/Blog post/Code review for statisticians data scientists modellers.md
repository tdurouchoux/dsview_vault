## Summary

This content discusses the importance and process of code review for statisticians, data scientists, and modellers, emphasizing the adoption of software development best practices. Key points include:

- **Purpose**: Code review helps ensure code quality, knowledge transfer, bug prevention, and compliance with standards.
- **Process**: Involves literal code review (annotating, suggesting changes), asking questions, identifying problems, suggesting improvements, and handling nitpicks (small stylistic issues).
- **Approach**: Reviewers should be inclusive, kind, and pragmatic, favoring open-ended questions and praising good work. Adopting a style guide and resolving stalemates through communication and additional reviewers are also highlighted.
- **Benefits**: Includes knowledge transfer, collaboration, bug prevention, quality assurance, and security.
- **Checklist**: Reviewers should check if the code runs, is clear, does what it should, has reasonable outputs, is accessible, has clear structure, is readable, and follows a consistent style.
- **Resolving Stalemates**: Strategies include accepting imperfect PRs, indicating the criticality of changes, and bringing in additional reviewers if necessary.
