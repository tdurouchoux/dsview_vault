## Summary

This content discusses the importance and process of code review for statisticians, data scientists, and modellers, emphasizing the adoption of software development best practices. The author, Jack Kennedy, targets professionals who write code for mathematical/statistical models and data-driven products but lack a software development background. The guide is tool-agnostic but leans towards R and GitHub.

Key points include:

- **Purpose of Code Review**: Ensures code quality, facilitates knowledge transfer, squashes bugs, and maintains compliance and security.
- **Review Process**: Involves literal code review, annotating code, and submitting reviews with comments, approvals, or change requests.
- **Reviewer's Role**: To understand the code through questioning, identify problems, suggest improvements, and provide minor nitpicks.
- **Review Approach**: Should be inclusive, kind, and style-guide compliant. Reviewers should ask open-ended questions and praise good work.
- **Resolving Stalemates**: Strategies for handling disagreements, such as favouring "good enough" PRs, prioritizing changes, and involving additional reviewers.

The author emphasizes the importance of code review in maintaining code health and team collaboration, and provides further reading resources.
