## Summary

The content discusses the issue of biased data in research and data science, focusing on survey data and other observational studies. Biases can arise from non-response or sampling issues, leading to erroneous insights or underperforming machine learning models. To mitigate these biases, statistical methods using auxiliary information (covariates) can be employed to create weights that adjust the data, making estimates or models less biased.

The article introduces "balance," a Python package developed by Meta for adjusting biased data samples. The package provides a simple, easy-to-use framework for weighting data and evaluating biases. The main workflow involves three steps: understanding initial bias, adjusting the data using propensity scores, and evaluating the final bias and variance inflation. The package offers several modeling approaches, including inverse propensity weighting, covariate balancing propensity scores, and post-stratification.

"balance" is released as an open-source project to benefit researchers, data scientists, and engineers working with potentially biased data in Python. The goal is to create an active community of practitioners to discuss methodology and build tools for survey-based research across academia and industry.
