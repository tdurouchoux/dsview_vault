## Summary

Anthropic has announced Claude 3.7 Sonnet, its most advanced model yet, featuring hybrid reasoning capabilities for both quick and extended thinking. It excels in coding and front-end web development and is available across all Claude plans and major cloud platforms. The model offers fine-grained control over thinking time and maintains the same pricing as its predecessors. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is designed to integrate reasoning seamlessly, improving performance on various tasks, including math, physics, and coding. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and TAU-bench. Additionally, Anthropic introduced Claude Code, a command line tool for agentic coding, available as a limited research preview. Claude Code assists with substantial engineering tasks directly from the terminal. The company has also improved the coding experience on Claude.ai with enhanced GitHub integration. Extensive testing and evaluations ensure Claude 3.7 Sonnet meets high standards for security, safety, and reliability. The model reduces unnecessary refusals by 45% compared to its predecessor. Anthropic aims to understand better how developers use Claude for coding to inform future model improvements. The goal is to create AI systems that can truly augment human capabilities, enabling deeper reasoning, autonomous work, and effective collaboration.
