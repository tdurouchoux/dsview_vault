## Summary

The article discusses the visualization of road networks in livable cities, combining data science and urban planning concepts. The author first identifies the top twelve most livable cities by merging six different rankings, with Zurich, Vienna, and Copenhagen topping the list. The author then uses ChatGPT to generate a color palette for visualizing these cities' road networks. The visualization is done using OSMnx, a Python package that allows for easy manipulation and analysis of geospatial data from OpenStreetMap. The article concludes with a gallery of the top twelve cities' road networks, visualized using the AI-generated color pairings. The author emphasizes the importance of urban network visualization in spatial data science applications, such as traffic jam forecasting and public transport reconstruction.
