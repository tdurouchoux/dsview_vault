## Summary

The article discusses the visualization of road networks in the most livable cities, as determined by merging six different rankings. The author, Milán Janosov, used OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate a color palette for the visualizations and OSMnx, a Python package, to download and manipulate geospatial data from OpenStreetMap. The top twelve cities identified were Zurich, Vienna, Copenhagen, Vancouver, Melbourne, Sydney, Geneva, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Tokyo, and Wellington. The article includes visualizations of these cities' road networks using the AI-generated color pairings. The author also briefly tested the process on a smaller town, Siklós, Hungary. The main goal is to provide a visual overview of the road networks in these livable cities, which is crucial for various spatial data science applications and urban planning concepts like the 15-minute city.
