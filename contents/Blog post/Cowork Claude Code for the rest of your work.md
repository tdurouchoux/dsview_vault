## Summary

Claude has introduced Cowork, a new feature that allows users to grant Claude access to specific folders on their computer, enabling it to read, edit, or create files within those folders. Cowork is designed to handle tasks with more agency than a regular conversation, planning and executing tasks while keeping the user informed. It is built on the same foundations as Claude Code and can perform similar tasks but in a more approachable form for non-coding activities.

Key features of Cowork include:
- **Folder Access**: Users can choose which folders Claude can access and work within.
- **Task Automation**: Claude can organize files, create spreadsheets, draft reports, and more, based on user instructions.
- **Connectors and Skills**: Claude can use existing connectors to access external information and new skills to create documents, presentations, and other files.
- **Parallel Tasking**: Users can queue up tasks, allowing Claude to work through them in parallel, making the interaction feel more like leaving messages for a coworker.

Safety and control measures include:
- **User Control**: Users can steer or course-correct Claude's actions.
- **Risk Awareness**: Users should be aware of potential risks such as prompt injections and the possibility of Claude misinterpreting instructions, especially for destructive actions like deleting files.
- **Precautions**: Users are advised to take precautions, particularly while learning how Cowork works.

Cowork is currently available as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers on the macOS app, with plans to improve and expand its features, including cross-device sync and availability on Windows. Users are encouraged to experiment with Cowork and provide feedback to help shape its future development.
