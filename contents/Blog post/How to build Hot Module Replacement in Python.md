https://www.gauge.sh/blog/how-to-build-hot-module-replacement-in-python
## Summary

The content discusses the implementation of Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Python to speed up development workflows, particularly for large projects where traditional hot-reloading methods are slow. The key points include:

1. **Dependency Maps**: A structure that maps files to their dependents, enabling precise identification of affected modules when changes occur. Tach, a Rust-based library, provides this functionality.

2. **Python Imports**: Understanding how Python handles imports and the `sys.modules` cache is crucial for implementing HMR.

3. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: The process of replacing modules in `sys.modules` in the correct order without a full restart. This involves managing module dependencies and avoiding cached versions of modules.

4. **Example Implementation**: A simplified HMR harness for WSGI applications is demonstrated, showing significant speed improvements (from 4.8s to ~6ms) by reloading only necessary modules.

5. **Cycle Handling**: A 'best-effort' approach to handle import cycles by recording the initial load order and using it to sort the closure generated from the dependency map.

6. **Conclusion**: Dependency mapping, facilitated by tools like Tach, is a powerful technique for enhancing developer workflows in large Python codebases. The full code for the example is available for further exploration.

The content also includes related blog posts on topics such as validating workspace dependencies, scaling to large codebases, and architectural considerations for monoliths and microservices.
