https://www.gauge.sh/blog/how-to-build-hot-module-replacement-in-python
## Summary

The content discusses how to implement Hot Module Replacement (HMR) in Python to speed up development workflows, particularly for large projects where traditional hot-reloading methods are slow. The key points include:

- **Dependency Maps**: A structure that maps file paths to their dependents, enabling precise identification of affected modules and streamlining incremental updates. Tach, a Rust-based library, provides this functionality.
- **Python Imports**: Understanding how Python's import system works, including the `sys.modules` cache, is crucial for implementing HMR.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: The process of replacing modules in `sys.modules` in the correct order without a full restart. The example focuses on a simplified form of HMR for WSGI applications.
- **Implementation**: Using a dependency map and recorded import order, the example demonstrates how to reload only the necessary modules, significantly reducing restart times. The implementation includes handling import cycles by recording the initial load order.
- **Conclusion**: Dependency mapping, facilitated by tools like Tach, is a powerful technique for enhancing developer workflows in large Python codebases.

The content also includes related blog posts on topics like validating dependencies, scaling codebases, and architectural decisions between monoliths and microservices.
