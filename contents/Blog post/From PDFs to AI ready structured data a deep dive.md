## Summary

The blog post discusses the challenges and solutions for converting PDFs into structured, AI-ready data. It emphasizes the importance of extracting data from PDFs early in the process to avoid operational complexity and improve task specificity. The post introduces a modular workflow using spaCy and Docling for PDF processing, which includes layout analysis, OCR, and table recognition. Key points include the use of spaCy's Doc object for structured data representation, the integration of tabular data via TableFormer, and the application of NLP techniques for information extraction. The post also highlights the role of human-in-the-loop annotation with Prodigy for creating high-quality training data. It concludes with future research directions and performance benchmarks, emphasizing the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed workflows.
