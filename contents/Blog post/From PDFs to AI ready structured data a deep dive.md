https://explosion.ai/blog/pdfs-nlp-structured-data
## Summary

The blog post discusses the challenges and solutions for converting PDFs and similar documents into structured, AI-ready data. Key points include:

1. **PDF Processing Challenges**: PDFs are ubiquitous but difficult to process due to their varied formats (plain text, scanned images, or a mix) and the relevance of their layout properties and embedded images.

2. **Modular Workflow**: The post introduces a modular workflow for converting PDFs into structured data, emphasizing the importance of extracting data from PDFs early to avoid complex, monolithic approaches.

3. **Tools and Techniques**: The post highlights tools like Docling (developed by IBM Research) and spaCyLayout, which combine modules for file parsing, layout analysis, OCR, table structure recognition, and postprocessing to generate structured data. These tools allow for end-to-end document understanding and information extraction.

4. **Practical Implementation**: The post provides a practical implementation guide using spaCy and Docling, demonstrating how to process PDFs, extract text and layout features, and apply NLP techniques like named entity recognition.

5. **Working with Tabular Data**: The post discusses the challenges and solutions for handling tabular data within PDFs, including the use of the TableFormer model and the integration of tables into the spaCyLayout pipeline.

6. **End-to-End Information Extraction**: The post explains how to use the extracted structured data for various NLP tasks, including transfer learning, data collection, and annotation using tools like Prodigy.

7. **Human-in-the-Loop Distillation**: The post emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop processes for data annotation and model training, highlighting the efficiency and accuracy benefits of breaking down tasks into simpler steps.

8. **Future Plans**: The post outlines future research directions, including the use of LLMs to rephrase tabular data, incorporating layout features into information extraction models, and improving data collection and annotation efficiency.

9. **Resources and Tools**: The post provides links to various resources, including spaCy Layout, Docling, Prodigy, and related technical reports and papers.

Overall, the blog post offers a comprehensive guide to processing PDFs and similar documents for AI-ready structured data, highlighting the tools, techniques, and best practices for effective document understanding and information extraction.
