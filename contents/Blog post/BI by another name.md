## Summary

The author discusses the concept of universal semantic layers in data management, highlighting two key components: defining business concepts and making them universally accessible. Current semantic layers, while useful, are limited in their accessibility and functionality, often serving as BI tools without visualization. The author argues that these layers should support a wider range of analytical work and be adaptable to various data consumption tools, but acknowledges the challenges in achieving this universality. The post also touches on the personal preferences in data tool usage and the need for a shared source of truth. The author speculates on the future of semantic layers, suggesting that they should be as flexible as SQL and support diverse analytical needs. The discussion is framed within the context of recent updates and trends in the data industry.
