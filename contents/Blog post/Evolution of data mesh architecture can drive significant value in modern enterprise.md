## Summary

The content discusses the evolution of data mesh architecture and its potential to drive significant value in modern enterprises. Key points include:

- **Data Value**: Data's value increases when combined with other data assets, enabling enterprise-wide visibility, real-time analytics, and accurate AI/ML predictions.
- **Data Sharing Paradox**: While sharing data across the enterprise can add value, it also increases risk. JPMorganChase addresses this by defining 'Data Products' and implementing a 'Data Mesh' architecture.
- **Data Products**: These are curated by domain experts who understand data management requirements, permissible uses, and limitations.
- **Data Mesh Architecture**: This aligns data technology with data products, empowering data product owners to make management and use decisions, enforcing those decisions by sharing data rather than copying it, and providing clear visibility of data sharing across the enterprise.
- **Implementation**: The architecture uses cloud services for storage, cataloging, and querying data, with physical separation between data lakes and consumer applications.
- **Control and Visibility**: The data mesh allows for granular access control and provides cross-enterprise visibility of data consumption through a cloud-based Mesh Catalog.
- **Example**: The architecture enables reporting teams to find and request lake-based data, with the mesh catalog allowing auditing of data flows.
- **Conclusion**: JPMorganChase's data mesh architecture aligns data technology solutions with their data product strategy, enabling data sharing while giving data owners the control and visibility they need.
