## Summary

JPMorganChase's data mesh architecture aims to maximize data value while managing risks. The approach involves defining 'Data Products' curated by domain experts and implementing a 'Data Mesh' architecture that aligns data technology with these products. Key aspects include:

1. **Data Product Strategy**: Data is grouped into products stored in separate, cloud-based data lakes, with physical separation between lakes and consumer applications.

2. **Empowering Data Product Owners**: Owners manage their data, make risk-based decisions, and facilitate quick access for consumers via an enterprise-wide data catalog.

3. **In-Place Consumption**: Data is shared rather than copied, ensuring up-to-date and accurate data, and easier enforcement of control decisions. Sophisticated access controls restrict visibility to specific data elements.

4. **Cross-Enterprise Visibility**: A cloud-based Mesh Catalog provides visibility into data flows across the enterprise, helping data product owners track data usage.

The architecture enables efficient data sharing, control, and visibility, supporting enterprise-wide analytics, AI/ML, and reporting.
