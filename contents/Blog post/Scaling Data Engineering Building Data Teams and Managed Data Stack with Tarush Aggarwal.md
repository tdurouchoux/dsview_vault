## Summary

The podcast episode features Tarush Aggarwal, Founder and CEO of 5x, discussing his journey and insights on data engineering, building data teams, and the modern data stack.

Key points include:

1. **Early Career and Education**: Tarush's passion for computer science started early, leading him to study at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on a research project involving Hadoop and astronomical data.

2. **Salesforce Experience**: Joined as the first data engineer, Tarush faced challenges with early data infrastructure, including manual log file processing. He developed an automation framework that empowered data scientists and streamlined analytics.

3. **Wyng and WeWork**: At Wyng, Tarush built a data team and implemented self-service reporting with Looker. At WeWork, he scaled the data team significantly and established operations in China, experiencing the "China speed" of development.

4. **Founding 5x**: After leaving WeWork, Tarush founded 5x, aiming to provide a managed data stack for companies. 5x offers a platform that integrates various data services and provides on-demand data engineering talent through an elastic "Engineering Pod" model.

5. **Industry Needs**: Tarush highlights the inefficiencies in setting up a modern data stack and the need for a bundled solution like 5x, which can save companies time and resources.

6. **Training and Partnerships**: 5x trains data engineers and partners with vendors in the modern data stack to create an app store-like ecosystem.

The episode provides valuable insights into the evolution of data engineering, the challenges of scaling data teams, and the future of managed data services.
