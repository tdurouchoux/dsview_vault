## Summary

The MTA's journey in establishing a central data team and a cloud-based analytics platform is detailed, highlighting key lessons learned. The main challenges identified were lack of shared data facilities, poor data access, and limited tools. To address these, the MTA built executive support, positioned the team centrally, partnered with IT, and defined clear roles separating data engineering from data science. Initial projects were chosen to demonstrate the platform's value, and an '80/20' solution was built for common data needs. Strategic project selection was emphasized, balancing visibility and technical debt reduction. The MTA's experience offers valuable insights for organizations, particularly in the public sector, looking to establish a central data function.
