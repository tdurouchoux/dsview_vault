## Summary

Transformers v5, released five years after v4, has seen significant growth with over 1.2 billion installs and 750,000 model checkpoints. The new version focuses on simplicity, training, inference, and production. Key improvements include a modular approach for easier model contributions, tooling for model conversion, and a streamlined codebase with PyTorch as the sole backend. Training support has been enhanced for both pre-training at scale and fine-tuning, with better compatibility with various tools. Inference has been optimized with new APIs and support for specialized kernels. The version also emphasizes interoperability with popular inference engines and local deployment options. Quantization is now a central focus, ensuring full compatibility with major features. The overarching theme of v5 is interoperability, making it easier to train, deploy, and run models across different tools and platforms.
