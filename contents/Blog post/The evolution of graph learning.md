## Summary

The blog post discusses the evolution of graph learning, highlighting key milestones and research contributions, particularly from Google researchers. It begins with the historical context of graph theory, starting with Leonhard Euler's work in 1736, and moves on to the application of graph algorithms in computing, such as PageRank in 1996. The post then delves into the integration of graph algorithms with machine learning, starting with DeepWalk in 2014, which combined graph data with neural networks. This was followed by the introduction of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in 2016 and message passing neural networks in 2017, which enabled more complex computations over graph data. The post also mentions the development of general graph neural network architectures and their applications in various fields like urban planning, healthcare, and finance. It concludes with a look at the future of graph learning, discussing the potential of integrating graph structured data with large language models (LLMs) and the challenges involved. The post emphasizes the importance of knowledge-sharing and mentions the release of libraries in TensorFlow and JAX for building models over graph data.
