## Summary

The article discusses the transformative impact of large language models (LLMs) on the field of natural language processing (NLP). It highlights key moments and perspectives from researchers, including the introduction of the transformer model in 2017, the release of BERT and GPT-3, and the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. The field experienced significant shifts, including debates about the capabilities and ethical implications of LLMs, as well as the disruption of traditional research paths. The article explores the challenges faced by academics, the influx of media attention, and the commercialization of AI research. It concludes with reflections on whether LLMs represent a paradigm shift, with varying opinions from experts in the field.
