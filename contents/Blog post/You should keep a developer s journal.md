## Summary

A developer's journal is a tool to track and organize thoughts, problems, and solutions related to coding tasks. It helps developers focus on one problem at a time, reduce ambiguity, learn from experiences, avoid distractions, and manage worries. The journal should be set up in a convenient place, with a clear and readable style, and customized as needed. Before coding, define the goal for the session. While coding, write when stuck or when figuring things out, and get ideas and questions out of the head. After finishing a task, reflect on the process. To succeed, make journaling a habit, be direct, reflect on needs, learn from experiences, and stay mindful. The journal should nudge thinking, increase mindfulness, and clear the mind for coding.
