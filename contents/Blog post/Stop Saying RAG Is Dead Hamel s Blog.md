## Summary

The blog post "Stop Saying RAG Is Dead" by Hamel Husain and Ben Clavié argues against the notion that Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is obsolete. The authors present a six-part series discussing the future of RAG and why it remains relevant.

Key points include:

- **What's Dead**: The 2023 marketing version of RAG, which involved simple vector database searches, is outdated. This approach fails because it loses critical information by compressing entire documents into single vectors.
- **Takeaways**:
  - Traditional IR metrics are inadequate for RAG; coverage, diversity, and relevance are more important.
  - Retrieval models can now reason and understand instructions, finding documents that traditional systems miss.
  - Late-interaction models like ColBERT preserve token-level information, outperforming single-vector models.
  - Multiple specialized representations are more effective than a single perfect embedding.
  - Larger context windows do not always improve performance; thoughtful retrieval and context engineering are crucial.
- **What's Next**: The future of RAG lies in better evaluation systems, reasoning retrievers, information-preserving representations, and intelligent routing among multiple indices.

The series includes annotated notes for each part, highlighting key points and providing context.
