## Summary

The VERDAD project, developed by Public Data Works and journalist Martina Guzm√°n, aims to track misinformation in Spanish-language radio broadcasts across the USA. The project uses a combination of audio transcription and analysis to identify potential misinformation, which is then reviewed by humans. The technology stack includes Prefect for workflow orchestration, Gemini 1.5 for transcription and misinformation detection, and Whisper for generating timestamps. The project processes around a thousand hours of audio content daily, making it feasible to analyze vast amounts of data that would be impossible to review manually. The prompts used for misinformation detection are complex and have been iterated over multiple months. The project is open to collaboration and is actively seeking conversations with others in the field. The use of new multi-modal LLM tools like Gemini 1.5 Flash has made such projects more affordable and feasible compared to just a year ago.
