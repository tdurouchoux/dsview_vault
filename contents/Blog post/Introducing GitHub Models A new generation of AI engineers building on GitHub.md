## Summary

GitHub introduces GitHub Models, a platform enabling over 100 million developers to become AI engineers by providing access to industry-leading AI models directly on GitHub. Key features include:

1. **Model Playground**: An interactive space to experiment with various models (e.g., Llama 3.1, GPT-4o, Mistral Large 2) for free, with no data sharing for training or improvement purposes.

2. **Model Comparison**: Developers can test and compare different models to suit specific needs, such as low latency (Mistral) or multimodal applications (GPT-4o).

3. **Codespaces Integration**: Seamless transition from the playground to a developer environment in Codespaces and VS Code, with sample code for various languages and frameworks.

4. **Production Deployment**: Easy deployment to production via Azure AI, offering responsible AI, enterprise-grade security, and global availability.

5. **Future Expansion**: GitHub plans to add more language, vision, and other models in the coming months.

The initiative aims to democratize AI access, fostering innovation and collaboration within the developer community. GitHub Models is now in limited public beta.
