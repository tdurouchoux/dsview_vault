## Summary

Jupyter AI is an open-source project that integrates generative AI capabilities into Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to explain and generate code, fix errors, summarize content, and create entire notebooks from natural language prompts. It supports various large language models (LLMs) from providers like AI21, Anthropic, AWS, Cohere, and OpenAI, with plans to support local models via LangChain.

Key features include:
- **Responsible AI**: Users can choose LLMs and embedding models, and Jupyter AI only contacts LLMs with explicit user consent.
- **Metadata Tracking**: AI-generated code cells include metadata for tracking.
- **Interfaces**: Offers a chat UI and magic commands (e.g., %%ai) for interacting with LLMs.
- **Local File Interaction**: Users can learn from and ask questions about local files using embedding models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

Installation is straightforward via pip, with versions available for JupyterLab 3 and 4. The project is vendor-neutral and prioritizes ethical considerations and social responsibility. Users are encouraged to contribute, report bugs, and join discussions to improve the project.
