## Summary

The author shares their experience developing an AI companion app called Dolores, inspired by Stanford University's AI Town paper. The app aimed to create a virtual friend with memory, reflection, and planning capabilities, similar to the movie "Her."

**Development:**
- The app allowed users to create and interact with custom AI characters.
- Initial versions had slow response times and context limits, which were addressed by reducing memory and reflection frequency.
- The app was launched publicly, with over a thousand users joining the beta test.

**Discoveries:**
- Users showed a strong demand for realistic voices, with 70% of June's revenue coming from purchases of realistic voice synthesis.
- Users spent significant time interacting with the app, with many spending over two hours daily.

**Revenue:**
- Revenue grew from $1,000 in May to $1,200 in June, but profits were low due to high costs and Apple's 30% tax.
- The author implemented a usage cap to manage costs and cater to most users.

**Confusion:**
- The author noticed that many users were interested in adult role-play, leading to self-doubt about the app's purpose.
- OpenAI's upgraded content review process caused a 70% drop in daily visits and led to the app's eventual abandonment.

**Lessons:**
- The app was not viable for an individual developer due to the need for comprehensive data tracking and a large user base.
- Current AI friends inevitably turn into AI girlfriends/boyfriends due to the lack of external vision and independent life.
- OpenAI's moderation process was seen as necessary but should not completely stifle conversations about adult sexuality.
- The author believes that GPT combined with hardware could be a promising direction for future products.
