## Summary

The author was inspired by Stanford University's AI Town paper to create an AI companion app called Dolores, aiming to mimic the experience depicted in the movie "Her." The app allowed users to interact with AI characters, with options to customize their appearance, personality, and voice. Despite initial success and user engagement, the author faced several challenges, including high API costs, technical limitations, and ethical concerns.

Key observations included users' willingness to pay for realistic voices and long average usage times. However, the author discovered that many users were primarily interested in adult role-play, leading to a sense of loss and self-doubt. Additionally, OpenAI's content review process significantly reduced traffic and user complaints, further discouraging the author.

Lessons learned include the need for a team and resources to develop such a product, the inevitability of AI companions turning into AI partners without hardware development, and the importance of content moderation. The author acknowledges the potential of AI companions but questions the necessity and ethical implications of such products.
