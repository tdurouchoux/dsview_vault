## Summary

The content discusses the concept of intelligent agents in AI, highlighting their potential to act as assistants, coworkers, and coaches. Agents are defined by their environment and the actions they can perform, which are augmented by tools. The post covers three main aspects: tools, planning, and failure modes.

**Tools** are categorized into knowledge augmentation (e.g., text retrievers, web browsing), capability extension (e.g., calculators, code interpreters), and write actions (e.g., SQL executors, email APIs). Tools enhance an agent's capabilities but also introduce security risks.

**Planning** is crucial for complex tasks and involves generating, validating, and executing plans. The post discusses different planning granularities, control flows (sequential, parallel, if statements, for loops), and the role of reflection and error correction in improving agent performance.

**Agent Failure Modes and Evaluation** focuses on identifying and measuring failures in planning, tool execution, and efficiency. Planning failures include invalid tools, incorrect parameters, and goal failures. Tool failures involve wrong outputs or translation errors. Efficiency is evaluated based on the number of steps, cost, and time taken to complete tasks.

The post concludes that agents, despite their complexity, are built on established concepts like self-critique and chain-of-thought. Future posts will explore agent framework evaluation and memory systems for agents.
