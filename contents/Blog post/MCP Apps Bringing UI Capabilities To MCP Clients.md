## Summary

MCP Apps, now live as an official MCP extension, enable tools to return interactive UI components like dashboards, forms, and visualizations directly in conversations. This extension builds on the work of MCP-UI and OpenAI Apps SDK, creating an open standard for UI components in MCP clients.

Key features include:
- **Interactive UIs**: Tools can return rich, interactive interfaces instead of plain text.
- **Use Cases**: Data exploration, configuration wizards, document review, and real-time monitoring.
- **Architecture**: Uses tools with UI metadata and UI resources served via the ui:// scheme.
- **Security**: Sandboxed iframes, pre-declared templates, auditable messages, and user consent.
- **Client Support**: Available in Claude, Goose, Visual Studio Code, and ChatGPT.

The App API allows developers to build new MCP Apps using the @modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps package. The future of agentic UI frameworks includes continued support and development from the community, with MCP-UI and OpenAI Apps SDK pioneering the patterns now standardized by MCP Apps.

Resources for getting started include documentation, quickstart guides, SDKs, and example repositories. Feedback and contributions are encouraged from the community.
