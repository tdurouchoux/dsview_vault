## Summary

The article discusses the emergence of Generative Business Intelligence (GenBI), a new era in business intelligence driven by AI and the declarative data stack. GenBI enables users to interact with data through natural language, generating dashboards, metrics, and data models based on conversational inputs. The key to GenBI is the declarative BI stack, where dashboards and metrics are defined as code, providing AI models with structured context to understand and work with business data.

The article explores the evolution from traditional BI to GenBI, highlighting the role of BI-as-Code in enabling AI to generate and modify BI artifacts. It discusses the core components of GenBI, including the metrics layer, which serves as the semantic foundation, and the natural language interface that allows human-like interaction with the system. The article also provides examples of GenBI in action, demonstrating how users can create and refine dashboards and metrics through conversational prompts.

Rill Developer is introduced as a practical implementation of GenBI, offering a CLI-first BI tool that integrates with common OLAP engines and data sources. The article concludes by envisioning the future of GenBI, suggesting that it will democratize access to data analytics and enable faster time-to-insight for businesses. The author expresses confidence that Rill Developer will be at the forefront of this evolution, integrating the BI part into the broader declarative data stack.
