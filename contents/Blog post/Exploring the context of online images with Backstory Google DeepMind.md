## Summary

Backstory is an experimental AI tool developed by Google DeepMind to help users explore the context and origin of online images. It uses Gemini, a next-generation AI model, to assess the trustworthiness of images by determining if they are AI-generated, digitally altered, or used out of context. Backstory provides users with easy-to-read reports and responds to further prompts for more information. The tool is part of Google's efforts to promote information literacy and empower users to make informed decisions about online content. It is currently being tested with content creators and expert information practitioners, with plans to gather feedback and improve the technology throughout the year. The development of Backstory involves collaboration with various teams and experts within Google DeepMind and Google.
