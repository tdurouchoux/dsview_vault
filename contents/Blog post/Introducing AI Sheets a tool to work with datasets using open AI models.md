## Summary

Hugging Face AI Sheets is an open-source, no-code tool for building, enriching, and transforming datasets using AI models. It integrates with the Hugging Face Hub and offers a spreadsheet-like interface for quick experimentation. Users can create new columns by writing prompts and iterate on results by editing or validating cells. The tool supports various use cases, including model comparison, prompt improvement, data transformation, classification, analysis, enrichment, and synthetic dataset generation. AI Sheets can be deployed locally or on the Hub and supports thousands of open models from the Hugging Face Hub. Users can export datasets to the Hub and run data generation scripts using HF Jobs. Examples of datasets built with AI Sheets are provided for inspiration. The tool is available for free use without installation or can be downloaded and deployed locally from the GitHub repo.
