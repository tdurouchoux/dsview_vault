2. **Introduction**: Read the introduction to grasp the problem the paper addresses, its significance, and the authors' approach.

3. **Figures and Tables**: Quickly scan figures, tables, and diagrams to understand the data, models, or processes described in the paper.

4. **Conclusion**: Read the conclusion to understand the paper's key findings and their implications.

5. **Section Headings**: Skim through section headings to get a sense of the paper's structure and main topics.

6. **References**: Check the references to understand the context and related work.
