## Summary

DocETL is an open-source system designed to simplify the creation of LLM-powered data processing pipelines for unstructured documents. It addresses challenges in processing complex, large-scale documents by offering declarative operators that enable powerful optimization. Key features include:

1. **Declarative Operators**: Users define pipelines using YAML or Python, which DocETL optimizes automatically.
2. **Agent-Based Optimization**: DocETL employs LLMs to enhance pipeline accuracy through query rewriting and quality assessment, decomposing complex operations into simpler, more accurate ones.
3. **Comprehensive Operators**: Includes operators like Split and Gather for handling long documents, and 13 LLM-specific rewrite rules for optimizing pipelines.
4. **Example Use Case**: Demonstrated through analyzing US presidential debate transcripts, showing significant improvements in theme extraction and viewpoint summarization.
5. **Future Vision**: Aims to develop a no-code, interactive system with fast, transparent optimization processes and reliable LLM agents.

DocETL is available for exploration and contribution via its demo, GitHub repository, and Discord community.
