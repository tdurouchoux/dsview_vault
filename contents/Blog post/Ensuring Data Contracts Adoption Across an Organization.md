## Summary

The article discusses the importance of data contracts in ensuring data quality and reliability within an organization, using a real-world example of a data science team's forecasting error due to lack of communication about changes in data calculation rules.

Key points include:

- **Data Contracts**: Formal agreements that document data model evolution, notify consumers of changes, and manage operational impact.
- **Governance Mechanisms**: Essential for controlling and communicating changes, anchored from the design phase within tools used by teams.
- **Failure Patterns**: Common issues in adopting data contracts include silent bypassing, passive resistance, lack of ownership, and excessive bureaucracy.
- **Governance-as-a-Service**: A facilitating body that makes the "virtuous path" easier than workarounds, addresses operational needs, and promotes accountability.
- **Organizational Strategy and Operational Processes**: Governance must clarify roles and responsibilities, establish standards, and integrate contracts into workflows.
- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Clear definition of roles such as Data Product Owner, Data Architect, Data Engineer, Data Owner, Data Quality Analyst, Data Governance Officer, and Contract Registry Admin.
- **Governance Process**: A collaborative journey that ensures contract quality and relevance, involving need identification, requirement writing, refinement, implementation, user approval, and communication.
- **Adoption Strategies**: Establishing an enabling team, providing standardized templates, structured training, and continuous support.
- **Success Metrics**: Monitoring business and organizational impact through metrics like critical data coverage, data quality improvement, reduction in time-to-market, decrease in data-related incidents, and team satisfaction.
- **Progressive and Iterative Approach**: Starting with a limited but significant scope, choosing early adopters carefully, and using feedback to refine governance.
- **Conclusion**: Data contracts governance and adoption is a journey that requires balance between structure and flexibility, control and autonomy, and investment in the human aspect as much as technical excellence.

The article emphasizes the importance of creating a data culture where quality and reliability are everyone's business.
