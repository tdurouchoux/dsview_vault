## Summary

The article discusses the importance of data contracts in ensuring data quality and reliability within an organization, using a real-world example of a data science team's forecasting error due to lack of communication about changes in data calculation rules.

Key points include:

- Data contracts should explicitly document changes, notify consumers, and manage operational impact.
- Governance mechanisms, such as control and communication, should be incorporated into contracts from the design phase.
- Common failure patterns in data contracts adoption include silent bypassing, passive resistance, lack of ownership, and excessive bureaucracy.
- A governance-as-a-service team should facilitate the adoption of data contracts by making the "virtuous path" easier than workarounds, addressing operational needs, and promoting accountability.
- Effective data contracts governance relies on clear role definition and a collaborative ecosystem.
- The governance process involves need identification, requirement writing, refinement, implementation, user approval, and communication.
- Adoption strategies include establishing an enabling team, providing training, and starting with a limited but significant scope.
- Success should be measured through business and organizational impact, such as data quality improvement and team satisfaction.
- Data contracts governance and adoption is a journey that requires a balance between structure and flexibility, control and autonomy, and investment in the human aspect.
