## Summary

The episode "Joan Is Awful" from Black Mirror's sixth season, available on Netflix, explores the ethical implications and potential misuse of artificial intelligence (AI) in the entertainment industry. The episode's plot revolves around a streaming platform called Streamberry, which is eerily similar to Netflix. The main character, Joan, unknowingly signs away her rights to her image and life story when she agrees to the platform's terms of service. Streamberry then uses advanced AI technology to create a series based on her life, featuring actress Salma Hayek.

The episode serves as a critique of the streaming industry's focus on data and content consumption over the value of the stories and the people who create them. It also highlights the potential for AI to replace human creativity and the importance of regulating AI technology to prevent such outcomes. The showrunner, Charlie Brooker, has expressed support for the ongoing Hollywood writers' strike, which is partly driven by concerns about the impact of AI on the creative industry. Brooker recently experimented with using ChatGPT to write a Black Mirror script, which, although technically sound, lacked originality and depth. This experience underscores the potential risks and challenges posed by AI in the creative process.
