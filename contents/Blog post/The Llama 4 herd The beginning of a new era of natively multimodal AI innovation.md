## Summary

Meta AI Research introduces the Llama 4 herd, marking a new era in multimodal AI innovation. The Llama 4 models are designed to enable personalized multimodal experiences and are available in three variants: Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick, and Llama 4 Behemoth.

**Key Technical Points:**

1. **Llama 4 Scout:**
   - 17 billion active parameters with 16 experts.
   - Best multimodal model in its class, outperforming previous Llama models and competitors like Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1.
   - Industry-leading context window of 10 million tokens.
   - Fits on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.

2. **Llama 4 Maverick:**
   - 17 billion active parameters with 128 experts.
   - Best multimodal model in its class, outperforming GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash.
   - Comparable to DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding with fewer active parameters.
   - Best-in-class performance-to-cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena.

3. **Llama 4 Behemoth:**
   - 288 billion active parameters with 16 experts.
   - Most powerful Llama model yet, still in training.
   - Outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on STEM benchmarks.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Multimodal Architecture:** Llama 4 models use a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, improving compute efficiency and quality.
- **Native Multimodality:** Early fusion integrates text and vision tokens, enabling joint pre-training with large amounts of unlabeled data.
- **Efficient Training:** Uses FP8 precision and achieves high model FLOPs utilization.
- **Context Length:** Llama 4 Scout supports an industry-leading context window of 10 million tokens.
- **Performance:** Both Llama 4 Scout and Maverick outperform competitors in various benchmarks.
- **Safeguards:** Built with pre- and post-training mitigations, system-level safeguards, and evaluations to ensure safety and reduce bias.
- **Open Source:** Llama 4 Scout and Maverick are available for download on llama.com and Hugging Face, promoting innovation and accessibility.

The Llama 4 models represent a significant advancement in AI technology, offering improved performance, efficiency, and multimodal capabilities.
