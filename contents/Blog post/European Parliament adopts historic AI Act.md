## Summary

The European Parliament has adopted the AI Act, a comprehensive regulation aimed at managing artificial intelligence's risks and fostering innovation. Key points include:

- **Risk-Based Approach**: The regulation imposes stricter requirements for higher-risk AI systems, with outright bans on the most threatening tools.
- **Prohibitions**: Bans on predictive policing, AI systems inferring sensitive personal attributes, and real-time facial recognition in public spaces (with some law enforcement exceptions).
- **Compliance Timeline**: Rules for AI models like ChatGPT will take effect 12 months after the law's publication, with other provisions requiring compliance within two years.
- **Penalties**: Fines range from €7.5 million to €35 million, depending on the infringement and company size.
- **Lobbying Influence**: The legislation faced significant lobbying from tech giants and startups, with watchdogs warning of potential weakening of the rules.
- **Future-Proofing**: Commissioner Thierry Breton emphasized the EU's resistance to special interests, resulting in a balanced, risk-based regulation.
