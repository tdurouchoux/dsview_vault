## Summary

MusicLM is an experimental AI tool from Google that turns text descriptions into music. Users can sign up to try it in AI Test Kitchen on the web, Android, or iOS. By inputting a prompt like "soulful jazz for a dinner party," MusicLM generates two versions of the song. Users can listen to both and provide feedback, which helps improve the model.

Google has been working with musicians to gather early feedback and explore how this technology can empower the creative process. MusicLM is designed to assist both professional musicians and beginners in expressing their creativity. The tool is part of Google's ongoing efforts in AI innovation and responsible development.
