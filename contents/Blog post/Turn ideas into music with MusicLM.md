## Summary

MusicLM is an experimental AI tool from Google that converts text descriptions into music. Users can sign up to try it on the web, Android, or iOS by entering prompts like "soulful jazz for a dinner party." The model generates two versions of the song, allowing users to provide feedback by selecting their preferred track, which helps improve the model.

Google has been collaborating with musicians to gather early feedback and explore how this technology can enhance the creative process. MusicLM is designed to assist both professional musicians and beginners in expressing their creativity. The tool is available for testing, and users are encouraged to sign up to experiment with MusicLM.
