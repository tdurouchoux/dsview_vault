## Summary

The content discusses the trade-off between moving quickly and building robust systems in data science, focusing on the dilemma faced by data scientists who prioritize speed over software engineering best practices. It introduces the concept of an "efficient frontier" from quantitative finance to model this trade-off, where data scientists must balance adding value, moving quickly, and building good systems.

Key points include:

1. **Data Scientist's Dilemma**: Data scientists often prioritize speed over building robust, well-documented, and tested code, leading to technical debt that slows them down in the long run.
2. **Properties of a Good ML System**: A good system should not break often, be easy to triage/debug, easy to understand, and easy to modify.
3. **Efficient Frontier**: This concept is used to model the trade-off between system quality and speed. Data scientists should aim to work along this frontier, optimizing both aspects as much as possible.
4. **Platform Mindset**: Adopting a platform mindset can help reduce this trade-off by encouraging efficiency and building new toolsets that improve the efficient frontier.
5. **Hamilton**: An open-source platform introduced to help data scientists build better systems without sacrificing speed. It standardizes dataflows in Python, making it easier to test, debug, understand, and modify code.

The content concludes by encouraging readers to explore Hamilton and join the community for further discussion and support.
