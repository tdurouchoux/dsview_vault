## Summary

Google has released updated versions of its video and image generation models, Veo 2 and Imagen 3, along with a new tool called Whisk. Veo 2 generates high-quality videos with improved realism and understanding of cinematography, while Imagen 3 produces brighter, better composed images with more diverse art styles. Both models are available in Google Labs tools, VideoFX and ImageFX. Whisk allows users to input or create images to remix subjects, scenes, and styles using Imagen 3 and Geminiâ€™s visual understanding capabilities. Veo 2 and Imagen 3 have achieved state-of-the-art results in head-to-head comparisons and are now available in VideoFX, ImageFX, and Whisk.
