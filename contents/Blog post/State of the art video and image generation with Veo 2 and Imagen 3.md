## Summary

Google has released updated versions of its video and image generation models, Veo 2 and Imagen 3, along with a new tool called Whisk.

**Veo 2** is a state-of-the-art video generation model that creates high-quality videos with improved realism and understanding of cinematography. It generates videos up to 4K resolution and minutes in length, with a better understanding of physics, human movement, and cinematographic techniques. Veo 2 is now available in VideoFX and will be expanded to YouTube Shorts and other products.

**Imagen 3** is an upgraded image generation model that produces brighter, better composed images with more diverse art styles. It follows prompts more faithfully and renders richer details and textures. The latest Imagen 3 model is rolling out globally in ImageFX.

**Whisk** is a new experiment from Google Labs that allows users to input or create images to convey their ideas, then remix them to create unique visuals. It combines Imagen 3 with Gemini’s visual understanding and description capabilities. Whisk is launching in the U.S. and can be used to create digital plushies, enamel pins, or stickers.
