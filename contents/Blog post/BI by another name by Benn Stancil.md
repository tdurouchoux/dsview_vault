## Summary

The author discusses the evolution and challenges of universal semantic layers in data management. Key points include:

1. **Semantic Layers**: These layers define business concepts and clean, join, and aggregate raw data. The focus is on their logical complexity, creation (human vs. AI), and deployment.

2. **Universal Accessibility**: Current semantic layers are queryable by generic APIs, supporting modularity and mix-and-match of BI tools. However, they are criticized for limiting analytical freedom and being more like BI tools without charts.

3. **Ideal Semantic Layer**: Should support more than reporting and self-serve analysis, providing governance for new ways to interact with data. The author questions how to achieve this universality.

4. **Data Consumption Tools**: Different tools cater to different preferences and use cases, reflecting permanent differences in opinion and preference. A shared source of truth is essential, but current semantic layers may not fully achieve this.

5. **Success Stories**: dbt Core and SQL are examples of tools that encode entities or computation universally. The author ponders how to combine these properties in an aspirational semantic layer.

6. **Critique of Metrics Layers**: Originally a collection of formulas, metrics layers are now expected to encode everything, which limits their usefulness. The author argues for flexibility to work with various tools.

The author concludes that universal semantic layers must be flexible enough to work with different data presentation tools to be truly useful, otherwise, they are just BI tools by another name.
