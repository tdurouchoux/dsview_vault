## Summary

The author discusses the concept of universal semantic layers in data management, highlighting two key aspects: defining business concepts and being universally accessible. Current semantic layers, while useful, are limited in their accessibility and functionality, often serving as BI tools without visualization. The author argues that these layers should support more than just reporting and self-serve analysis, and should be flexible enough to work with various data consumption tools. The post also explores the challenges of creating a truly universal semantic layer that can be used across different tools and preferences, drawing parallels with the diversity of to-do list apps. The author suggests that future semantic layers should be as versatile as SQL, encoding both entities and computation, but acknowledges the complexity of this task. The post concludes by emphasizing the need for semantic layers to be flexible and universally applicable to avoid being just another BI tool.
