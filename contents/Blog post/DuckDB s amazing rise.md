## Summary

DuckDB's success is attributed to its unique corporate structure, where the open-source project is managed by the DuckDB Foundation, separate from monetization efforts by contributors like MotherDuck. This model allows DuckDB to focus solely on engineering and community feedback, avoiding the need for expensive go-to-market teams. Contributors fund specific features, ensuring high-priority development. DuckDB's structure enables rapid, high-quality development, giving it a competitive edge over traditional SaaS companies. The foundation model ensures open access and long-term success, with potential for broader adoption and monetization by various providers. The author suggests this model could be replicated for other projects with clear utility, but may not suit all segments equally.
