## Summary

The content discusses the rapid rise and success of DuckDB, an open-source in-process SQL OLAP database management system. The author attributes DuckDB's success to its unique corporate structure, which is managed by the DuckDB Foundation. This structure allows DuckDB to focus solely on engineering and development, without the need for expensive go-to-market (GTM) teams like marketing and sales. The foundation model enables DuckDB to receive customer feedback and feature requests indirectly through contributor organizations like MotherDuck, which have a vested interest in the project's success. This model allows DuckDB to avoid the typical product skewing that occurs in VC-funded SaaS companies chasing product-market fit. The author suggests that this model could be replicated by other projects with similar obvious utility, but notes that it may not be suitable for all types of projects. The content also compares DuckDB's model to that of PostgreSQL and discusses the potential for hyperscalers to offer DuckDB as a service. The author concludes that the DuckDB Foundation model has worked better than the Apache model for data projects and could provide a blueprint for other open-source projects.
