## Summary

The article discusses the development and impact of Splink, an open-source Python package for data linking and deduplication, created by a team at the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The author, Robin Linacre, highlights the challenges of data linking, including variations in records and computational intensity, and the benefits of solving these issues, such as improved data quality and richer datasets.

Linacre contrasts historical, siloed approaches to data linking with the collaborative, open-source development of Splink. Key features of Splink include speed, accuracy, scalability, cross-platform compatibility, unsupervised learning, and interactive outputs. The software has been successfully used by the MoJ and other organizations, including government departments, private sector companies, academia, and charities.

The success of Splink is attributed to its open-source nature, which facilitates expert advice, continuous improvement through user feedback, faster bug fixes, and increased motivation among contributors. The article advocates for more open-source projects in government to break down silos and promote collaboration. Linacre acknowledges the initial funding from ADR UK and expresses gratitude to all users and contributors of Splink.
