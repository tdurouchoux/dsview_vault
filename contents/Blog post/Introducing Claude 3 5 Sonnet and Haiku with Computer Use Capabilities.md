## Summary

Anthropic has introduced an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet and a new Claude 3.5 Haiku model, along with a groundbreaking "computer use" capability in public beta. Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows significant improvements, particularly in coding, and is the first model to offer computer use, enabling it to interact with computers like a human. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of the larger Claude 3 Opus model at a similar speed. The computer use feature allows Claude to perform tasks by navigating computer interfaces, though it is still experimental. Early adopters like Replit and GitLab have begun exploring these capabilities. Both models will be available across various platforms, with Claude 3.5 Haiku releasing later in the month. Anthropic emphasizes responsible deployment and continuous improvement of these new features.
