## Summary

Google introduces Gemma, a new family of open, lightweight, state-of-the-art models built using the same research and technology as Gemini models. Gemma is available in two sizes: Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B, with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. Key features include:

1. **Performance**: Gemma models achieve best-in-class performance for their sizes and can run on laptops or desktops.
2. **Responsibility**: Designed with Google's AI Principles, Gemma includes safety measures like data filtering, fine-tuning, and a Responsible Generative AI Toolkit for developers.
3. **Versatility**: Gemma supports various tools, frameworks (JAX, PyTorch, TensorFlow), and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs and Google Cloud TPUs.
4. **Accessibility**: Free access is available via Kaggle, Colab notebooks, and Google Cloud credits for first-time users and researchers.
5. **Optimization**: Gemma is optimized for Google Cloud, with Vertex AI providing MLOps tools and deployment options.

Gemma is released to foster innovation, collaboration, and responsible AI development within the open community. Developers can start using Gemma today and explore quickstart guides on ai.google.dev/gemma.
