## Summary

This content provides an introduction to prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. It begins by defining a prompt as the textual input used to interact with generative AI models, which can range from simple questions to complex problems with data. The post then breaks down the elements of a prompt, including instructions, questions, input data, and examples. Basic and advanced prompt examples are provided, demonstrating how to combine these elements effectively. The post also discusses the iterative nature of prompt engineering, the importance of understanding the model, and the need for a programmatic approach when generating prompts at scale. Advanced techniques such as chain of thought prompting, encouraging factual responses, and role-playing are explored. The post concludes with a list of resources, including videos, posts, papers, tools, and other lists of resources for further learning.
