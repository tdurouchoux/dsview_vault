## Summary

This content provides an introduction to prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and ChatGPT. It begins by defining a prompt as the textual input used to interact with generative AI models, which can range from simple questions to complex problems with data. The key elements of a prompt are instructions, questions, input data, and examples.

The guide then explores basic prompt examples, demonstrating how to combine these elements to achieve desired outcomes. It also introduces advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as chain of thought prompting, encouraging factual responses, self-correction, generating different opinions, maintaining state, role-playing, and teaching algorithms through prompts.

The content emphasizes that prompt engineering is an iterative process that requires domain understanding and knowledge of the specific model being used. It also highlights the importance of a programmatic approach to generating prompts at scale.

Finally, the guide provides a list of resources, including videos, posts, papers, tools, and other lists of resources related to prompt engineering. These resources offer further insights and practical applications for those interested in exploring the topic more deeply.
