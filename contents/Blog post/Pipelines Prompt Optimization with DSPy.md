## Summary

DSPy is a framework that allows users to program language models (LLMs) rather than manually crafting prompts. It uses "signatures" to define desired inputs and outputs, which are then used by modules to generate prompts. The framework supports prompt optimization based on training data, and it can leverage different LLMs for task execution and prompt generation. The example provided demonstrates categorizing historic events, showing how DSPy can improve accuracy through prompt optimization and model comparison. Key takeaways include the ease of defining tasks with signatures, the ability to optimize prompts for better performance, and the flexibility to use different models for different parts of the process.
