## Summary

The content discusses the pitfalls of building AI products by simply wrapping existing models like ChatGPT and offers an alternative approach. Key points include:

1. **Issues with Wrapping LLMs**:
   - **Lack of Differentiation**: Easy to copy, leading to competition and lack of unique value.
   - **High Cost**: LLMs are expensive to run, often costing more than users are willing to pay.
   - **Slow Performance**: LLMs can be too slow for real-time applications.
   - **Limited Customization**: Fine-tuning LLMs may not significantly improve performance for specific use cases.

2. **Alternative Approach**:
   - **Create Your Own Toolchain**: Combine fine-tuned LLMs, custom compilers, and custom-trained models.
   - **Start with Normal Code**: Use traditional programming to solve as much of the problem as possible before introducing AI.
   - **Specialized Models**: Use AI only for specific, well-defined tasks that are difficult to solve with standard code.

3. **Benefits of Controlling Your Own Models**:
   - **Control Over Destiny**: Ability to constantly improve models and adapt to user feedback.
   - **Privacy Control**: Ensures data privacy and compliance with user requirements.

4. **Practical Example**:
   - **Visual Copilot**: A tool that converts Figma designs into high-quality code using a combination of hand-coded logic and specialized AI models.
   - **Data Generation**: Use resources like the Internet to generate data for training models.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Use AI sparingly and only for specific tasks where it provides significant advantages.
   - Focus on building a toolchain that combines traditional code with specialized AI models for optimal performance, cost, and differentiation.
