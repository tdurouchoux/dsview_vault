## Summary

The content discusses the pitfalls of building AI products by simply wrapping existing models like ChatGPT and offers an alternative approach. Key issues highlighted include lack of differentiation, high costs, slow performance, and limited customization of large language models (LLMs). The author suggests creating a custom toolchain combining fine-tuned LLMs, custom compilers, and custom-trained models for better performance, cost-efficiency, and uniqueness. The solution involves starting with normal programming to identify areas needing specialized AI, then integrating AI models only where necessary. This approach allows for faster, more reliable, and cheaper products that are harder for competitors to replicate. The author shares their experience building Visual Copilot, demonstrating how combining code and specialized AI models can produce high-quality, responsive websites quickly and cost-effectively. Benefits include controlling your own destiny, improved privacy, and the ability to constantly improve models based on user feedback. The article concludes by recommending this hybrid approach for building AI products, emphasizing the importance of using AI sparingly and strategically.
