## Summary

Google Cloud has announced the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), an open protocol developed with leading payments and technology companies to securely initiate and transact agent-led payments across platforms. AP2 is designed to address critical questions of authorization, authenticity, and accountability in AI agent transactions, providing a common language for secure, compliant transactions between agents and merchants.

Key features of AP2 include:

- **Mandates and Verifiable Credentials**: Tamper-proof, cryptographically-signed digital contracts that serve as verifiable proof of a user's instructions, ensuring secure and auditable transactions.
- **Support for Various Payment Types**: From credit and debit cards to stablecoins and real-time bank transfers, ensuring a consistent, secure, and scalable experience.
- **Flexible Design**: Supports both simple and new commercial models, enabling smarter shopping, personalized offers, and coordinated tasks.
- **Support for Emerging Payments Systems**: Designed as a universal protocol, providing security and trust for a variety of payments like stablecoins and cryptocurrencies.

AP2 is supported by a diverse group of over 60 organizations, including Adyen, American Express, Ant International, Coinbase, Etsy, Forter, Intuit, JCB, Mastercard, Mysten Labs, Paypal, Revolut, Salesforce, ServiceNow, UnionPay International, Worldpay, and more. The protocol is open for collaboration, with a public GitHub repository for technical specifications, documentation, and reference implementations.

The broader ecosystem, including Accenture, Adobe, Airwallex, BHN, BVNK, Checkout.com, Confluent, Dell, Deloitte, DLocal, Ebanx, Eigen Labs, Fiuu, Forter, Gr4vy, Gravitee, Global Fashion Group, JusPay, KCP, Lightspark, ManusAI, MetaMask, Mesh, Mysten Labs, Nexi, Okta, Payoneer, PwC, Shopee, Worldpay, and 1Password, has expressed support for AP2, highlighting its potential to transform commerce and payments.
