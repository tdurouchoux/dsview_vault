## Summary

The Cnaf introduced a new data mining model, DMDE 2026, in January 2026 to help target controls for benefit payments, ensuring the right amount is paid. This model is part of an ethical approach, overseen by a committee and guided by a charter, to ensure transparency and minimize bias. The algorithm assists in identifying potential overpayments or underpayments but does not make autonomous decisions; human agents still make the final call. The model uses reliable data from Caf, excluding sensitive variables like nationality, gender, and address to reduce discrimination risks. It employs a logistic regression method for clarity and explainability. The code for DMDE 2026 is available in open source, allowing public scrutiny of its variables and calculations. The model adapts to recent regulatory changes, such as the generalization of solidarity at source, and includes specific criteria to target significant and prolonged overpayments. The ethical framework, combined with transparent practices, aims to build trust and ensure fair treatment of beneficiaries.
