## Summary

The blog post discusses continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), a less commonly known cousin of discrete-time Markov chains in machine learning. The author aims to build intuition about how CTMCs work and their connection to discrete diffusion models.

Key points include:

1. **Markov Chains**: Both discrete and continuous-time Markov chains are stochastic processes where the future state depends only on the current state, not the past.

2. **Discrete-Time Markov Chains**: These are described by transition matrices that can change over time (non-homogeneous) or remain constant (homogeneous).

3. **Continuous-Time Markov Chains**: For homogeneous chains, the waiting time in a state follows an exponential distribution (memoryless property), and transitions occur based on a rate matrix.

4. **Point Processes**: The post explores the relationship between Markov chains and point processes, illustrating this with an Easter Bunny egg-hiding analogy. Different processes (Bernoulli, Geometric, Binomial) lead to the same outcome, demonstrating the equivalence of different representations.

5. **Continuous Point Processes**: By replacing discrete distributions with continuous ones (exponential for waiting times, Poisson for point processes), the post shows how to model continuous-time Markov chains.

6. **Simulation of Markov Chains**: The post describes how to simulate a Markov chain using underlying Poisson point processes, where transitions occur when a point process associated with the current state "fires."

7. **Non-Homogeneous Chains**: The post hints at the complexity of extending these ideas to non-homogeneous chains, where the rate matrix changes over time, leaving it as an exercise for the reader.

The summary emphasizes the memoryless property, the role of exponential distributions, and the connection between Markov chains and point processes, providing a foundation for understanding discrete diffusion models.
