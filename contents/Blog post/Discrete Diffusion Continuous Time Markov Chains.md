## Summary

The blog post discusses continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), a less commonly known concept in machine learning compared to discrete-time Markov chains. The author aims to build intuition about how CTMCs work, as they are featured in recent work on discrete diffusion models.

Key points include:

1. **Markov Chains**: Both discrete and continuous-time Markov chains are defined by their memory-less property, where the future state depends only on the current state.

2. **Discrete-Time Markov Chains**: These are described by state transition matrices, which can be time-varying or constant (homogeneous).

3. **Continuous-Time Markov Chains**: For homogeneous chains, the waiting time between state transitions follows an exponential distribution, preserving the memory-less property. The rate matrix (Î› or Q) replaces transition probabilities.

4. **Point Processes**: The post explores the relationship between Markov chains and point processes, illustrating this with an Easter egg-hiding analogy. Different processes (Bernoulli, geometric, binomial) can generate the same point process distribution.

5. **Continuous Point Processes**: By replacing discrete distributions with continuous ones (exponential and Poisson), the post describes homogeneous Poisson point processes and their connection to Markov chains.

6. **Simulation of Markov Chains**: The post explains how to simulate a Markov chain using underlying Poisson point processes, with each state pair having an associated point process. Transitions occur when a point process "fires."

7. **Non-Homogeneous Markov Chains**: The post hints at the complexity of extending these concepts to non-homogeneous chains, where the rate matrix changes over time, and suggests this as a topic for further exploration.

The author summarizes the key ideas, emphasizing the memory-less property, the role of exponential distributions, and the connection between Markov chains and point processes. The post aims to provide intuition and different representations of CTMCs, highlighting their relevance in discrete diffusion models.
