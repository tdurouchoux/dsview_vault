## Summary

The Kaggle Grandmasters Playbook outlines seven battle-tested techniques for solving real-world tabular data problems, emphasizing fast experimentation and careful validation. Key techniques include:

1. **Smarter EDA**: Beyond basic checks, compare train vs. test distributions and analyze target variables for temporal patterns to avoid real-world failures.
2. **Diverse Baselines**: Build a variety of baselines (linear models, GBDTs, neural nets) to understand data landscape and set performance benchmarks.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Generate thousands of features using GPU-accelerated cuDF to uncover hidden patterns.
4. **Hill Climbing**: Ensemble models by systematically adding and weighting them to improve validation scores.
5. **Stacking**: Train a second-level model on the outputs of base models to capture complex patterns.
6. **Pseudo-Labeling**: Use model predictions to label unlabeled data, improving robustness and performance.
7. **Extra Training**: Train models with different random seeds and retrain on all data to boost performance.

GPU acceleration (via cuDF, cuML, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) is crucial for making these techniques practical at scale. The playbook is grounded in principles of fast experimentation and careful validation, with resources provided for implementing GPU acceleration.
