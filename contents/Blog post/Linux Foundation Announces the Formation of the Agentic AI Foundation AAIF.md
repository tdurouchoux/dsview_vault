## Summary

The Linux Foundation has established the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), supported by key projects from Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. The AAIF aims to foster open, collaborative development of agentic AI technologies. Key contributions include:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** by Anthropic: A universal standard for connecting AI models to tools, data, and applications, widely adopted by major AI platforms.
- **goose** by Block: An open-source, local-first AI agent framework that integrates language models and tools using MCP.
- **AGENTS.md** by OpenAI: A universal standard for providing project-specific guidance to AI coding agents, enhancing reliability across repositories.

Platinum members of the AAIF include AWS, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. The foundation will host events like the MCP Dev Summit to promote community engagement and innovation. The AAIF is designed to ensure transparency, interoperability, and community-driven development in the agentic AI ecosystem.
