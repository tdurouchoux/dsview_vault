## Summary

The article discusses the challenges and considerations in patient clustering for medical research, highlighting the lack of validation and alignment with clinical goals in many studies. Key points include:

- **Background**: Patient clustering is often used to find new phenotypes but is frequently misapplied and not statistically validated. The article critiques a study by Ahlqvist et al. that claimed to find new diabetes subtypes, arguing that direct modeling of outcomes would be more beneficial.

- **Purpose and Goals**: Researchers should clearly define the ultimate goal of clustering, whether the disease is binary, and the best way to summarize results. Variable clustering is often more effective than patient clustering.

- **Presentation of Results**: Forced-choice classification is not always the best way to present clusters. Continuous methods, such as using distances from cluster centers or probabilities of membership, are often more appropriate.

- **Validation of Clusters**: Clusters must be validated for adequacy of summarization and stability. This involves checking the compactness of clusters, comparing predictive information, and demonstrating new prognostic information.

- **Clinical Usefulness**: Ultimately, clusters must be validated by demonstrating clinical usefulness, such as interpretability, homogeneity within clusters, and capturing differential treatment effects.

The article emphasizes the importance of careful validation and alignment with clinical goals in patient clustering studies.
