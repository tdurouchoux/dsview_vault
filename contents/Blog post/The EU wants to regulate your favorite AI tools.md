## Summary

The article discusses the EU's plans to regulate generative AI models like Stable Diffusion, LaMDA, and ChatGPT, which have gained significant popularity. The EU's AI Act, expected to be finalized in the second half of 2023, will likely require companies to be more transparent about how their models are built and trained. The regulation aims to address issues such as harmful AI-generated content and biased outcomes. The article also highlights the potential for AI models to be used in various applications, from customer service chatbots to creating disinformation. Additionally, it mentions Microsoft's plans to integrate ChatGPT into Bing searches and other products, and Apple's launch of AI-voiced audiobooks. The piece also notes the growing concern among artists about AI taking their jobs and the efforts of lawmakers like Don Beyer to better understand AI technology.
