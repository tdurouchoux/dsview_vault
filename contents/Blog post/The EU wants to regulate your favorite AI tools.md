## Summary

The EU is planning to regulate generative AI models like Stable Diffusion, LaMDA, and ChatGPT through its AI Act, which is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2023. These models, referred to as "general-purpose AI" systems, can be used for various applications but also pose risks such as generating harmful content or biased outcomes. The EU aims to force companies to be more transparent about how their models are built and trained, with fines of up to 6% of total worldwide annual turnover for non-compliance. The regulation is expected to address two main issues: the dissemination of harmful AI-generated content and the potential for biased outcomes in applications like hiring processes or legal document reviews. The article also highlights the growing trend of generative AI and its potential impact on various industries, as well as the push for more transparency and corporate accountability in AI development. Additionally, it mentions Microsoft's plans to integrate ChatGPT into its products and Apple's launch of AI-voiced audiobooks, both of which have sparked concerns about job displacement and the ethical use of AI.
