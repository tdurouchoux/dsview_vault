## Summary

The author discusses the challenges of data integration in industrial and manufacturing contexts, highlighting that the buzzwords like "digital transformation" and "Industrial Internet of Things" ultimately mean putting a company's data on computers for analysis. Key points include:

1. **Data Accessibility**: Many companies have data scattered across different machines, departments, or even on paper, making it difficult to access and analyze.

2. **Data Integration Challenges**: To analyze data, it needs to be obtained, digitized (if necessary), cleaned, and stored in a standardized format. This process is labor-intensive and requires significant effort.

3. **Human and Political Barriers**: Obtaining data can be challenging due to security concerns, inter-departmental rivalries, and personal objections from employees who fear job replacement or performance scrutiny.

4. **Palantir's Approach**: Palantir, a data integration company, uses a large number of employees to negotiate for data access, set up databases, and teach users how to use their tools. Their success relies heavily on human interaction and negotiation.

5. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning is a crucial and time-consuming step that involves removing errors, formatting adjustments, and understanding the context of the data. It is difficult to automate and requires human judgment.

6. **AI's Dependence on Data Integration**: For AI to have a significant economic impact, it needs to integrate with business data, which requires time, effort, and human adaptation. The author compares this process to the gradual adoption of computers in the business world.

The author concludes that while AI has great potential, its implementation and impact will be gradual, moving at the speed of human negotiation and learning.
