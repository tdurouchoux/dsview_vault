## Summary

The content introduces Atla Selene 1, a state-of-the-art LLM Judge designed for evaluating generative AI responses. Key points include:

- **Performance**: Selene 1 outperforms other frontier models, including OpenAI's o-series, Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek's R1, across 11 benchmarks.
- **Capabilities**: It excels in various evaluation tasks such as absolute scoring, classification, and pairwise preference, providing actionable critiques.
- **Customization**: Selene 1 is highly steerable, allowing users to customize evaluation criteria precisely.
- **Eval Copilot**: A new tool launched in open beta to help users generate, test, and refine custom evaluation metrics with minimal prompt engineering.
- **Availability**: Selene 1 is available via API and SDK, with comprehensive documentation and default metrics to facilitate easy integration into existing workflows.

The content also highlights Selene's ability to capture human preferences on nuanced evaluations and its performance on specific benchmarks like FLASK, MT-Bench, Auto-J, and RewardBench.
