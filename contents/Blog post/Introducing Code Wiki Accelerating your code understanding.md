## Summary

Code Wiki is a new platform introduced by Google to accelerate code understanding and address the bottleneck of reading existing code. It maintains a continuously updated, structured wiki for code repositories, offering an intelligent, context-aware chat and integrated, actionable documentation. Key features include:

- **Automated & Always Up-to-Date**: Scans the full codebase and regenerates documentation after each change.
- **Intelligent & Context-Aware**: Uses the entire, always-current wiki as the knowledge base for an integrated chat.
- **Integrated & Actionable**: Hyper-links every wiki section and chat answer directly to relevant code files and definitions.
- **Visualization**: Automatically generates architecture, class, and sequence diagrams to visualize complex relationships.

The Code Wiki website is now available in public preview, ingesting public repositories and generating comprehensive, interactive documentation. Additionally, a Gemini CLI extension is in development to allow teams to run the system locally and securely on internal repositories. The goal is to shift the focus from deciphering code to building, making the development process more efficient.
