## Summary

The article outlines a mental model for running data science projects, drawing from the author's extensive experience at AWS and Amazon. The key points include:

1. **Problem Definition**: The importance of starting with a well-defined business problem. Vague problems are common, and scientists often need to identify concrete projects to focus on.

2. **Stakeholders and Scoping**: Identifying stakeholders and assessing the project's potential impact is crucial. The author advises starting from the ground up and ensuring stakeholders are willing to invest resources.

3. **Metrics and Success Definition**: Defining what success looks like and establishing clear metrics and experimentation plans. Stakeholder involvement and commitment are essential at this stage.

4. **Execution**: This is the easiest part if the previous steps are well-handled. Flexibility in execution allows adaptation based on the project's nature. Regular check-ins and clear milestones help track progress.

The author emphasizes the importance of aligning stakeholders on results and ensuring that the project's output is not just a validation of their assumptions. The model is flexible and can be adapted based on the specific needs of the project.
