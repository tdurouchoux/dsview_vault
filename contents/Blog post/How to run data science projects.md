## Summary

The article outlines a mental model for running data science projects, drawing from the author's experience at AWS and Amazon. The key points include:

1. **Problem Definition**: Start by ensuring the business problem is well-defined. Vague problems are common, and it's crucial to identify concrete projects that align with business goals, such as increasing profitability.

2. **Stakeholders and Scoping**: Identify stakeholders and assess the project's potential impact. Avoid projects with low ROI and consider repurposing existing solutions. Ensure stakeholders are committed to investing resources, including data access, testing, and maintenance.

3. **Metrics and Success Definition**: Define what success looks like and establish metrics for the experimentation phase. Involve stakeholders in setting clear expectations and committing resources. For example, a model's success might be defined as being 10% above a baseline.

4. **Execution**: This phase is the easiest if the previous steps are well-handled. Execution can happen sequentially or in parallel, depending on the project's nature. Regular check-ins and prototypes help realign with stakeholders and stay on track.

The author emphasizes the importance of clear communication, stakeholder involvement, and flexible execution to ensure the success of data science projects.
