## Summary

AlphaEarth Foundations is an AI model developed by Google DeepMind that integrates vast amounts of Earth observation data to create a unified digital representation of the planet's terrestrial land and coastal waters. This model addresses the challenges of data overload and inconsistency by combining information from various sources, such as optical satellite images, radar, 3D laser mapping, and climate simulations. It analyzes the world in 10x10 meter squares, providing a detailed and consistent view of the planet's evolution.

Key features of AlphaEarth Foundations include:

1. **Data Integration**: Combines data from dozens of public sources to create a comprehensive view of the planet.
2. **Compact Summaries**: Generates highly compact summaries for each analyzed square, reducing storage space and cost.
3. **Accuracy**: Outperforms traditional methods and other AI systems in accuracy, with a 24% lower error rate on average.
4. **Applications**: The Satellite Embedding dataset, powered by AlphaEarth Foundations, is used by organizations worldwide for tasks like classifying unmapped ecosystems, monitoring agricultural and environmental changes, and improving the accuracy and speed of mapping work.

The model's capabilities are being explored further, with potential future applications in combining with general reasoning LLM agents like Gemini to enhance its time-based capabilities. The work is a collaboration between teams at Google DeepMind and Google Earth Engine.
