## Summary

The author, Sebastian Ruder, discusses the evolving AI and NLP job market in 2024, highlighting several key trends and sharing his reasons for joining Cohere.

1. **Research Trends**: Research has become more applied, with a narrower gap between fundamental and applied research. This shift has led to more opportunities and emerging research areas, but also requires balancing short-term impact with long-term research potential.

2. **Startups as an Alternative to PhDs**: Startups offer a viable path to cutting-edge AI work, providing faster skill acquisition and hands-on experience with emerging methodologies. However, they may not suit everyone, and a PhD remains valuable for personal growth and curiosity-driven research.

3. **Decline in Openness**: The ML community has become less open, with major companies releasing less information about their models. This trend may impede progress, but some companies and organizations continue to support open-source AI.

4. **Concentration of Research**: Research is increasingly concentrated in large projects, with a growing number of authors per publication. This trend poses challenges for effective execution and prioritization, and may deprioritize other research directions.

5. **More Companies, More Opportunities**: The advent of LLMs has led to a wave of new companies and opportunities. However, choosing the right company can be challenging.

The author then outlines the criteria that led him to join Cohere, including the company's commitment to openness and community, its mature startup status, remote work enablement, alignment with his personal goals, and its team and culture. He encourages readers to consider these factors in their own job search.
