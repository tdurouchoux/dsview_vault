## Summary

The author reflects on the evolving AI and NLP job market, highlighting several key trends:

1. **Research Shift**: NLP research has become more applied, with advances directly impacting real-world applications. This shift has led to new opportunities but also challenges, such as balancing short-term impact with long-term research potential.

2. **Startups as Alternatives**: Startups are now serious alternatives to PhDs for those interested in cutting-edge AI work. They offer faster skill acquisition and hands-on experience with emerging methodologies but require a specific mindset and flexibility.

3. **Decline in Openness**: The ML community has become less open, with major companies releasing less information about their models. This trend could impede progress but is countered by other companies and organizations continuing to release open-source models.

4. **Large-Scale Collaborations**: Research is increasingly concentrated in large projects with many authors. This trend poses challenges for effective execution and prioritization but also reflects the strategic importance and complexity of current AI developments.

5. **More Opportunities**: The advent of LLMs has led to a wave of new companies and opportunities. However, many research challenges remain, and effectively using LLMs for business use cases requires addressing various issues.

The author also shares personal reasons for joining Cohere, including the company's commitment to openness, mature startup environment, support for remote work, alignment with societal goals, and strong team culture. The post concludes with advice on assessing a company's culture and considering career options in the AI field.
