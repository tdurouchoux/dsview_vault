## Summary

The report summarizes the state of machine learning (ML) competitions in 2024, highlighting key trends and technical insights. Over 400 ML competitions took place, with a total prize pool exceeding $22 million across more than 20 platforms. Notable trends include the resurgence of grand challenges with significant prize money, the dominance of Python and PyTorch among winners, and the increasing use of quantisation techniques in LLM-related competitions. Gradient-boosted tree models remained popular, and there was a notable use of AutoML packages in narrow applications. The report also discusses the performance of various hardware configurations and the demographics of winning teams. Specific competitions like the AI Mathematical Olympiad and the ARC Prize are highlighted for their innovative approaches and substantial prize pools. The report concludes with insights into future trends, including inference-time scaling and ongoing competitions.
