## Summary

Google has introduced Gemma, a new family of open, lightweight, state-of-the-art models designed for responsible AI development. Built using the same research and technology as the Gemini models, Gemma is available in two sizes: Gemma 2B and Gemma 7B, each with pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. Key features include:

- **Performance**: Gemma models achieve best-in-class performance for their sizes and can run on laptops or desktops.
- **Responsibility**: Designed with Google's AI Principles, Gemma includes safety measures like data filtering, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). A Responsible Generative AI Toolkit is also provided to help developers build safe AI applications.
- **Versatility**: Gemma supports multiple frameworks (Keras 3.0, PyTorch, JAX, Hugging Face Transformers) and hardware platforms, including NVIDIA GPUs and Google Cloud TPUs. It can be fine-tuned for specific applications like summarization or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
- **Accessibility**: Gemma is available worldwide, with free access in Kaggle, a free tier for Colab notebooks, and $300 in credits for first-time Google Cloud users. Researchers can apply for additional Google Cloud credits.

Google encourages developers and researchers to explore Gemma and looks forward to future innovations with the model.
