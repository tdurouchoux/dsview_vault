## Summary

The authors predict a significant shift in reinforcement learning (RL), akin to the impact of GPT-3 on language models. Currently, RL models are pre-trained and fine-tuned on specific tasks, leading to poor generalization. They anticipate a move towards massive-scale training across diverse environments, enabling strong few-shot, task-agnostic abilities. This shift will require vast amounts of training data, comparable to major software projects like Windows Server 2008 or GTA V, measured in tens of thousands of years of human effort.

To achieve this, they propose "replication training," where AI models replicate existing software products or features. This approach leverages abundant existing software data, simplifies evaluation, and targets critical skills like understanding instructions, executing tasks precisely, and sustaining performance. Despite challenges like writing effective tests and the artificial nature of replication tasks, the authors believe this paradigm will scale RL environments significantly, unlocking robust, task-agnostic performance. However, they acknowledge that this may not lead to full automation of labor, but could serve as a bridge to the next paradigm.
