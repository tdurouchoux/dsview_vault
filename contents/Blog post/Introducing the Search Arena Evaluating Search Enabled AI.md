## Summary

Search Arena is a crowdsourced evaluation platform for search-augmented LLM systems, focusing on current events and real-world use cases. Based on 7k human votes, Gemini-2.5-Pro-Grounding and Perplexity-Sonar-Reasoning-Pro are top-performing models. Key findings include:

1. **Model Performance**: Gemini-2.5-Pro-Grounding and Perplexity-Sonar-Reasoning-Pro lead, followed by other Perplexity models, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Grounding, and OpenAI's web search API models.

2. **Citation Style**: Standardizing citation styles had minimal impact on rankings.

3. **Key Features**: Response length, citation count, and citing specific web sources like YouTube and online forums/blogs positively correlate with human preference.

4. **Data and Code**: The dataset (search-arena-7k) and analysis code are open-sourced for further exploration.

Future plans include open participation, cross-task evaluation, and raising the bar for open models.
