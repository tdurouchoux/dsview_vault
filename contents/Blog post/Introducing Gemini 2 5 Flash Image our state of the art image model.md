## Summary

Google has introduced Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, a state-of-the-art image generation and editing model. Key features include:

- **Multi-image fusion**: Blend multiple images into a single image.
- **Character consistency**: Maintain the appearance of a character or object across multiple prompts and edits.
- **Prompt-based editing**: Perform targeted transformations and precise local edits using natural language.
- **World knowledge**: Utilize Gemini's world knowledge for new use cases, such as interactive education tutors.
- **Pricing**: $30.00 per 1 million output tokens, with each image being 1290 output tokens ($0.039 per image).

The model is available via the Gemini API, Google AI Studio for developers, and Vertex AI for enterprise. Google AI Studio's "build mode" has been updated to make it easier to test and build apps with the model. All images created or edited with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image will include an invisible SynthID digital watermark. The model is currently in preview but will be stable in the coming weeks.
