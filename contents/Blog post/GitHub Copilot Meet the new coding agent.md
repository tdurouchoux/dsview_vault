## Summary

GitHub has introduced a new coding agent for GitHub Copilot, which operates directly within GitHub and VS Code. This agent can be assigned tasks or issues, and it works in the background using GitHub Actions to create a secure and customizable development environment. The agent excels at low-to-medium complexity tasks such as adding features, fixing bugs, extending tests, refactoring code, and improving documentation.

Key features include:

1. **Task Assignment**: Assign issues to Copilot via github.com, GitHub Mobile, or GitHub CLI.
2. **Background Processing**: The agent reacts with an ðŸ‘€ emoji and starts working, pushing commits to a draft pull request.
3. **Security**: Existing policies like branch protections apply, and human approval is required before any CI/CD workflows run.
4. **Advanced Capabilities**: Uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) powered by GitHub code search and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for external data access.
5. **Review and Collaboration**: The agent tags developers for review, incorporates feedback, and follows repository instructions.

The agent is designed to handle routine tasks, allowing developers to focus on more complex and creative work. It is available to Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ customers, with usage tracked via premium requests. The agent integrates with various IDEs, including Xcode, Eclipse, Jetbrains, and Visual Studio.
