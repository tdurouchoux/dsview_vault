## Summary

GitHub has introduced a new coding agent for GitHub Copilot, designed to automate low-to-medium complexity tasks in well-tested codebases. This agent can be assigned tasks via GitHub issues or prompts in VS Code, and it operates within a secure, customizable development environment powered by GitHub Actions. The agent pushes commits to a draft pull request, allowing developers to track its progress and review its work before any CI/CD workflows are executed.

Key features include:

1. **Task Assignment**: Assign tasks to the agent via GitHub issues or prompts in VS Code.
2. **Secure Environment**: The agent operates within a secure environment with limited internet access and requires human approval for CI/CD workflows.
3. **Advanced Capabilities**: Utilizes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for enhanced functionality.
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing GitHub tools and policies, ensuring security and compliance.
5. **Review Process**: Developers can review and comment on the agent's work, with the agent automatically incorporating feedback.

The agent is available to Copilot Enterprise and Copilot Pro+ customers and can be activated in various IDEs, including Xcode, Eclipse, Jetbrains, and Visual Studio. The goal is to amplify developers' work by handling routine tasks, allowing them to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their projects.
