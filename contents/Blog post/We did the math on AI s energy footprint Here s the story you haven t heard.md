## Summary

The article from MIT Technology Review explores the energy consumption and carbon footprint of AI, focusing on the growing impact of AI queries and data centers. Key points include:

1. **Energy Consumption**: AI's energy use is significant and growing, with data centers doubling their electricity consumption from 2017 to 2023. AI-specific servers are projected to use between 165 and 326 terawatt-hours per year by 2028, which could power 22% of US households annually.

2. **Carbon Footprint**: Data centers use dirtier energy sources, with carbon intensity 48% higher than the US average. The emissions from AI could equate to driving over 300 billion miles by 2028.

3. **Query-Specific Energy Use**: The energy required for a single AI query varies widely based on the model size, type of output, and energy source. For example, generating a high-quality image uses about 2,282 joules, while a five-second video requires about 3.4 million joules.

4. **Future Projections**: AI's energy demands are expected to surge as AI becomes more integrated into daily life and more complex tasks are performed by AI agents. This could lead to a significant increase in energy consumption and emissions.

5. **Lack of Transparency**: Tech companies are not disclosing enough information about their energy use and emissions, making it difficult to plan for AI's future impact on energy grids and emissions.

6. **Economic Impact**: The costs of the AI revolution may be transferred to consumers through higher electricity bills, as utility companies make deals with data centers that could raise rates for average residential ratepayers.

The article emphasizes the need for better transparency and planning to manage AI's growing energy demands and environmental impact.
