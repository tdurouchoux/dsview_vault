## Summary

The article discusses the significant and growing energy consumption and carbon footprint of AI, particularly focusing on the energy used for AI queries and the broader implications for the energy grid and climate change. Key points include:

1. **Energy Consumption**: AI's energy use is substantial and growing, with data centers consuming a significant portion of the US's energy. The carbon intensity of electricity used by data centers is 48% higher than the US average.

2. **AI Queries**: The energy required for individual AI queries varies widely based on the type of model, the complexity of the prompt, and the energy source. Text, image, and video generation each have different energy demands, with video generation being particularly energy-intensive.

3. **Future Projections**: AI's energy demands are expected to increase dramatically. By 2028, AI could consume as much electricity annually as 22% of all US households. The proliferation of AI agents and more complex AI tasks will further increase energy consumption.

4. **Energy Sources**: Data centers often rely on dirtier, more carbon-intensive forms of energy, such as natural gas and coal. While tech companies are investing in nuclear and renewable energy, these sources are not yet sufficient to meet the growing demand.

5. **Lack of Transparency**: There is a lack of transparency from AI companies regarding their energy use and emissions. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the environmental impact of AI and plan for future energy needs.

6. **Economic and Environmental Costs**: The costs of the AI revolution may be transferred to consumers through higher electricity bills. The environmental costs, in terms of increased emissions, are also significant.

7. **Call for Action**: The article calls for more transparency from AI companies, better planning for energy infrastructure, and consideration of the environmental impact of AI as it becomes more integrated into daily life.
