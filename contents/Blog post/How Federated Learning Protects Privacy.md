## Summary

Federated learning is a machine learning approach that enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data, addressing privacy concerns. It allows devices or organizations to train a global model using local data, with only model updates being shared. This approach is particularly useful for sensitive data, such as health records or personal messages, where data sharing is restricted.

Key points include:

1. **Privacy Preservation**: Federated learning keeps raw data local, minimizing data exposure and enhancing privacy.
2. **Secure Aggregation**: Techniques like secure aggregation and secure enclaves are used to combine local models without revealing individual contributions.
3. **Training Process**: Federated learning involves multiple rounds of local training and federated averaging, where local models are combined to form a global model.
4. **Challenges**: Outliers and differential privacy are important considerations. Outliers can affect model quality, and differential privacy techniques can be used to prevent individual data from being inferred from the global model.
5. **Trade-offs**: There is a trade-off between privacy, accuracy, and the amount of data used. More data can improve accuracy but increases computational costs.
6. **Applications**: Federated learning can be applied across various domains, such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and urban mobility, enabling collaborative learning without compromising data privacy.
